# OAuth for Tools

Many of Obot's included tools integrate with third party services and require OAuth 2.0 to authenticate the user.
These can be configured in the Tools page, by clicking on the warning icon in the top left corner of the tool's card.
Each tool comes with its on instructions on how to set up and register an OAuth app for the service it uses.
