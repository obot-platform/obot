# MCP Server Catalog

Obot allows an administrator to configure a list of MCP Servers that will be available to users. In Obot, an admin can either manually add individual configurations for the following 3 types of MCP Server:

* Single User Server
* Multi-User Server
* Remote Server

In addition to manually adding MCP Servers one at a time, the admin can also choose to add servers from a github repository. For an example of the format Obot is expecting, see our included catalog of MCP Servers [here](https://github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog)

## Access Control

Obot allows the admin to select what MCP Servers users will have access to - either by individual user or group. Using this mechanism you could allow different users to have access to different MCP Servers.

To configure this, go to the Obot Admin and select `Access Control` from the left sidebar. There you will be able to see and edit existing rules, as well as add new ones.
