# Chat Interface Configuration

The Chat Interface Configuration sets global defaults and system-wide settings that affect all projects and users in your obot deployment. These configurations provide baseline settings that individual projects can inherit and customize.

## Global Project Defaults

### Model Configuration
- **Default Model Provider**: Which LLM provider to use by default for new projects
- **Model Selection**: Available models that projects can choose from
- **Model Limits**: Resource constraints and usage quotas per model
- **Fallback Models**: Backup models to use if primary models are unavailable

### Tool Integration
- **Available MCP Servers**: Which tool catalogs and MCP servers are accessible
- **Default Tools**: Tools that are enabled by default for new projects
- **Tool Permissions**: System-wide restrictions on tool usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Constraints on tool execution frequency

### Knowledge & RAG
- **File Upload Limits**: Maximum file sizes and formats allowed
- **Processing Settings**: How knowledge documents are indexed and processed
- **Retention Policies**: How long knowledge data is stored
- **External Connectors**: Default settings for Notion, OneDrive, web crawling

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set key-value pairs of environment variables that will be available to all tools called by projects:

```bash
# Example environment variables
API_TIMEOUT=30
DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

These variables are inherited by all projects but can be overridden at the project level.

### System Prompts
- **Base Instructions**: Common instructions included in all project system prompts
- **Safety Guidelines**: System-wide safety and ethical guidelines
- **Behavior Defaults**: Default personality and communication style settings
- **Context Limits**: Token limits and context window management

### User Interface
- **Theme Settings**: Default light/dark mode and UI customization
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable specific chat interface features
- **Layout Preferences**: Default sidebar, panel, and layout configurations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and accessibility options

## Project Templates

### Template Configuration
- **Default Templates**: Pre-configured project templates for common use cases
- **Template Inheritance**: How templates inherit from global settings
- **Custom Templates**: Organization-specific project templates
- **Template Permissions**: Who can create and modify templates

### Common Templates
- **General Assistant**: Basic conversational AI with common tools
- **Document Analyst**: Specialized for document analysis and summarization
- **Code Assistant**: Development-focused with programming tools
- **Research Assistant**: Enhanced with web browsing and analysis capabilities

## Resource Management

### Compute Resources
- **Concurrent Threads**: Maximum simultaneous conversations per user
- **Processing Limits**: CPU and memory constraints for chat operations
- **Response Timeouts**: Maximum time allowed for agent responses
- **Queue Management**: How requests are prioritized and processed

### Storage Quotas
- **User Storage**: File storage limits per user
- **Project Storage**: Storage limits per project
- **Knowledge Storage**: Limits on knowledge base size
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old data

## Security Settings

### Content Filtering
- **Input Filtering**: Sanitization of user inputs
- **Output Filtering**: Content moderation for agent responses
- **File Scanning**: Security scanning of uploaded files
- **URL Filtering**: Restrictions on web content access

### Privacy Controls
- **Data Retention**: How long conversation data is kept
- **Anonymization**: Options for anonymizing user data
- **Audit Logging**: What chat activities are logged
- **Cross-Project Isolation**: Prevent data leakage between projects

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Usage Tracking
- **Activity Metrics**: Track user engagement and chat volume
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and system performance
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor LLM and compute costs
- **Error Monitoring**: Track and alert on system errors

### Reporting
- **Usage Reports**: Periodic reports on system usage
- **Performance Reports**: System health and performance analysis
- **Cost Reports**: Detailed cost breakdowns and projections
- **Security Reports**: Security events and compliance status

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with restrictive settings and gradually relax as needed
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track how settings affect user behavior and system performance
3. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and update configuration settings
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of configuration changes
5. **Testing**: Test configuration changes in staging before production

### Performance Optimization
1. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits to prevent resource exhaustion
2. **Caching**: Enable caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across available resources
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
5. **Capacity Planning**: Plan for growth and peak usage periods

These global chat interface settings provide the foundation for consistent, secure, and performant AI agent interactions across your entire obot deployment.
