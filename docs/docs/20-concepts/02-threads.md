# Threads

A thread represents each chat conversation between an obot and a user, or the execution of a task.
If you want to start a new chat with an obot, you can open up the side panel and click the plus icon in the threads section.
Each thread is a clean slate and will not have any of the messages from previous threads.
Each thread also has its own credentials, so for any tools that require authentication, you will need to re-authenticate.
