# Threads

A thread represents each chat conversation between an agent and a user or the execution of a workflow.
On the Threads page, you'll find a list of all threads within your system.
Clicking on a thread will display all related messages and metadata, such as files created or uploaded by the user.

Deleting a thread will permanently remove it from the system.
If a deleted thread was associated with an agent, the user's chat history with that agent will be lost, and any new conversation will start afresh.
