# Users

The **Users** page displays all the users in your system. Users can be configured as admins by following our [configuration guide](/configuration/general).
Non-admin users, referred to as "end-users" in this documentation, only have access to the chat interface available at the root of the domain where Obot is running.
For example, if the admin interface is accessed at `https://obot.acmecorp.com/admin`, the end-user chat interface would be available at `https://obot.acmecorp.com/`.
