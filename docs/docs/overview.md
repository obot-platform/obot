Obot is an open-source MCP Gateway and AI platform that can be deployed in the cloud or on-prem.

## Getting Started

To quickly try a live demo of the Obot MCP Gateway and chat experience, visit [https://chat.obot.ai](https://chat.obot.ai).

You can use Docker to quickly spin up the Obot MCP Gateway server locally to try out the full capabilities. Using something like [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/). Once that‚Äôs ready, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name obot -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<API KEY> ghcr.io/obot-platform/obot:latest
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the Obot UI.

> **Note:** The Docker command above is intended for local testing and evaluation only. For production deployments, we recommend running Obot on Kubernetes. See our [Installation Guide](/installation/overview) for detailed production setup instructions.

:::tip
You need to replace `<API KEY>` with your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Setting this is optional, but you'll need to setup a model provider from the Admin UI before using chat.

You can also set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` here as well, setting the value to your [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

Setting both is also supported, but OpenAI models will be set as the defaults.

## The Three Parts of Obot

The platform consists of three main components that work together to deliver a comprehensive AI solution.

### üîå MCP Gateway

The **MCP Gateway** is where users discover and connect to MCP servers using any MCP client. It provides:

- **Server Discovery** ‚Äì Browse a catalog of MCP servers tailored to your role and permissions
- **Configuration Management** ‚Äì Manage all MCP server settings and credentials in one place
- **Upgrade Management** ‚Äì Receive notifications about available server upgrades and apply them easily
- **Broad Client Support** ‚Äì Connect with local clients such as Claude Desktop and VS Code or use our hosted Obot Chat
- **OAuth 2.1 Authentication** ‚Äì Securely authenticate with external services

### üó£Ô∏è Chat

The **Chat Interface** is where users interact with AI through natural, conversational chat. It‚Äôs the primary way to ask questions, get answers, and work with connected tools and data. Key features include:

- **Chat Threads** ‚Äì Keep discussions organized and maintain context over time
- **MCP Server Integration** ‚Äì Connect to SaaS platforms, APIs, and other tools through [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Knowledge Integration** ‚Äì Use built-in RAG to add relevant knowledge to your conversations
- **Tasks** - Create and schedule repeatable tasks that can leverage all the same capabilities as Chat
- **Project-Based Customization** ‚Äì Tailor AI's behavior to meet your needs with custom instructions, knowledge, and MCP servers at the project level

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin

The **Admin Interface** provides comprehensive platform management tools for administrators:

- **Catalog Management** ‚Äì Create and update MCP server entries using GitOps or the admin portal
- **Server Deployment and Hosting** - Let Obot deploy and host MCP servers to ease your operational burden
- **Access Control Rules** ‚Äì Define which users and groups can access specific MCP servers
- **Audit Logging** ‚Äì Track and record all MCP server and client interactions
- **Request Filtering** ‚Äì Programmatically inspect and reject requests to/from MCP servers for enhanced security and compliance
- **User Management** ‚Äì Manage users, groups, and access permissions
- **Model Provider Management** ‚Äì Configure and manage LLM providers and settings for the Chat Interface
- **Centralized Authentication** - Integrate with your existing auth provider to ensure proper user authentication and authorization
- **Monitoring** ‚Äì View system health metrics and usage analytics

## How They Work Together

These three components create a powerful, integrated AI platform:

1. **Users** interact with Obot projects through the **Chat Interface** and MCP Servers through the **MCP Gateway**.
2. **Users** and **MCP Clients** leverage tools via the **MCP Gateway**
3. **Administrators** manage the entire platform through the **Admin Interface**

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure for complete control
- **MCP Standard**: Built on the open Model Context Protocol for maximum interoperability
- **Enterprise Security**: OAuth 2.1 authentication, encryption, and audit logging
- **Extensible**: Easy integration with custom tools and services
