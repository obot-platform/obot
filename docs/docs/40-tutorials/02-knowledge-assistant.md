# Create an HR Q&A Obot

Obot makes it easy to create an **obot** that can answer questions about a set of documents using its built-in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) feature.  
This guide walks you through creating an HR Q&A obot step by step.

> **Note:**  
> As you configure the obot, changes are saved and applied automatically â€” no need to click "Save".

## 1. Setting up the Obot

Start by going to [Obot](https://obot.ai) scroll down and click **+ New Obot** to begin creating a new one.  

In the **General** section on the left side, you can:  

- Set the **Name** and **Description** to describe your obot (e.g., "HR Policy Q&A").
- Write **Instructions** that tell the obot how to behave. This is a system prompt that guides its responses.

**Example Instructions:**  
> "You are an HR assistant that answers employee questions based on official company HR policies and procedures. Always be clear, concise, and refer to the relevant policy where possible."

## 2. Adding Documents

To provide the obot with knowledge, scroll down to the **File Knowledge** or **Website Knowledge** section in the left sidebar.  

- Use **File Knowledge** to upload files directly from your device.  
- Use **Website Knowledge** to scrape content from websites, if applicable.  

## 3. Testing the Obot

Once you've added your documents, test the obot using the **chat interface** on the right side of the screen.

Ask sample questions like:  
> "What is the company's remote work policy?"  
> "How many sick days are provided annually?"  

This helps ensure the obot is answering correctly based on the documents provided.

## 4. Sharing or Publishing the Obot (Optional)

If you want to share the obot with others:  

- Use the **Share** section in the left sidebar.
- Click **Share** and copy the link to share with others.
