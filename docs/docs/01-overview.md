Obot is an open-source AI platform and MCP Gateway that can be deployed in the cloud or on-prem. The platform consists of three main components that work together to provide a comprehensive AI solution.

To quickly view a demo environment, you can visit our [hosted version](https://chat.obot.ai).

## The Three Parts of Obot

### üó£Ô∏è Chat
The **Chat Interface** is where users interact with AI through natural, conversational chat. It‚Äôs the primary way to ask questions, get answers, and work with connected tools and data. Key features include:

- **Chat Threads** ‚Äì Keep discussions organized and maintain context over time
- **MCP Server Integration** ‚Äì Connect to SaaS platforms, APIs, and other tools through [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Knowledge Integration** ‚Äì Use built-in RAG to add relevant knowledge to your conversations
- **Tasks** - Create and schedule repeatable tasks that can leverage all the same capabilities as Chat
- **Project-Based Customization** ‚Äì Tailor AI's behavior to meet your needs with custom instructions, knowledge, and MCP servers at the project level

### üîå MCP Gateway
The **MCP Gateway** is where users discover and connect to MCP servers using any MCP client. It provides:

- **Server Discovery** ‚Äì Browse a catalog of MCP servers tailored to your role and permissions
- **Configuration Management** ‚Äì Manage all MCP server settings and credentials in one place
- **Upgrade Management** ‚Äì Receive notifications about available server upgrades and apply them easily
- **Broad Client Support** ‚Äì Connect with local clients such as Claude Desktop and VS Code or use our hosted Obot Chat
- **OAuth 2.1 Authentication** ‚Äì Securely authenticate with external services


### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin
The **Admin Interface** provides comprehensive platform management tools for administrators:

- **MCP Server Catalog Management** ‚Äì Create and update MCP server entries using GitOps or the admin portal
- **Access Control Rules** ‚Äì Define which users and groups can access specific MCP servers
- **Audit Logging** ‚Äì Track and record all MCP server and client interactions
- **Request Filtering** ‚Äì Programmatically inspect and reject requests to/from MCP servers for enhanced security and compliance
- **User Management** ‚Äì Manage users, groups, and access permissions
- **Model Provider Management** ‚Äì Configure and manage LLM providers and settings for the Chat Interface
- **Centralized Authentication** - Integrate with your existing auth provider to ensure proper user authentication and authorization
- **Monitoring** ‚Äì View system health metrics and usage analytics


## How They Work Together

These three components create a powerful, integrated AI platform:

1. **Users** interact with Obot projects through the **Chat Interface** and MCP Servers through the **MCP Gateway**.
2. **Users** and **MCP Clients** leverage tools via the **MCP Gateway**
3. **Administrators** manage the entire platform through the **Admin Interface**

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure for complete control
- **MCP Standard**: Built on the open Model Context Protocol for maximum interoperability
- **Enterprise Security**: OAuth 2.1 authentication, encryption, and audit logging
- **Extensible**: Easy integration with custom tools and services
