Obot is an open source AI assistant platform that can be deployed self-hosted in the cloud or on-prem.

To quickly view a demo environment, you can visit our [hosted version](https://chat.obot.ai).

## What is an Obot Project?

Projects are individual AI assistants that work with you to solve day-to-day problems and improve your productivity. Each project can be customized for specific tasks or domains, making them versatile tools for various workflows.

### What can Projects do?

- **Work with tools**: Projects accomplish complex tasks by working with a rich set of tools, like browsers, applications, email, systems, APIs or just about anything.
- **Create content**: They are creative and will work with you to generate documents, databases, emails, images and code, and write it all to your own personal workspace.
- **Collaborate and share**: When you've created a project you think is useful, you can share it with anyone and they can also use it.

## Platform Features

The Obot platform provides everything you need to build and deploy powerful AI assistants:

- **Built-in RAG** for connecting your Obots to your organization's data
- **Easy integration** with custom or private web services and APIs
