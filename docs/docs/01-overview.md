Obot is an open source AI assistant platform that powers both our SaaS offering and self-hosted deployments. The Obot SaaS platform is built on top of the same open source technology that you can deploy yourself, offering flexibility in how you access and control your AI assistants.

To quickly get started try our hosted [SaaS platform](https://obot.ai).

## What is an Obot?

Obots are individual AI assistants that work with you to solve day-to-day problems and improve your productivity. Each obot can be customized for specific tasks or domains, making them versatile tools for various workflows.

### What can Obots do?

- **Work with tools**: Obots accomplish complex tasks by working with a rich set of tools, like browsers, applications, email, systems, APIs or just about anything.
- **Create content**: They are creative and will work with you to generate documents, databases, emails, images and code, and write it all to your own personal workspace.
- **Collaborate and share**: When you've created an Obot you think is useful, you can share it with anyone and they can also use it.

## Platform Features

The Obot platform provides everything you need to build and deploy powerful AI assistants:

- **Built-in RAG** for connecting your Obots to your organization's data
- **Easy integration** with custom or private web services and APIs
- **Seamless connectivity** with leading Language Model providers
- **Enterprise-grade security** with OAuth 2.0 authentication
