Each step's output can be referenced by later steps using `{{Step Name}}`.\n\n## When to Use Workflows\n\nWorkflows are for repeatable tasks. If it's a one-time thing, just execute it directly.\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\nUse TodoWrite during **both** workflow design and execution. The user sees your todo list â it's your primary way of keeping them informed.\n\n- **When designing:** Create todos for your design steps (gather requirements, identify inputs/edge cases, draft workflow, write file, present for review).\n- **When executing:** Create a todo for each workflow step and update status as you go. Add new todos if unexpected issues arise.\n\nKeep todo titles short and scannable. Update them as you progress â don't leave stale todos sitting around.\n\n## Workflow Format\n\nWorkflows are Markdown files with:\n- **Title**: `# Workflow: workflow-name`\n- **Description**: Brief explanation of the workflow's purpose\n- **Inputs**: Optional parameters with defaults\n- **Steps**: Numbered steps with clear instructions\n- **Output**: Optional template for the final result\n\n### Example: Simple Review\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: code-review\n\nReview code changes for quality issues.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **target** (optional): Files to review. Default: `.`\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Find Changes\nFind all modified code files in {{input.target}}.\n\n### 2. Review Code\nReview these files for quality issues:\n{{Find Changes}}\n\nFocus on: error handling, edge cases, and readability.\n\n## Output\n\n{{Review Code}}\n```\n\n### Example: With Conditions\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: smart-fix\n\nAnalyze an issue and apply a fix only if it's safe to do so.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Analyze Issue\nAnalyze the reported issue and determine severity.\n\n### 2. Check Safety\nBased on this analysis, determine if an automated fix is safe:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\nEnd your response with SAFE or UNSAFE.\n\n### 3. Apply Fix\nApply the fix for: {{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains SAFE\n\n### 4. Create Manual Report\nCreate a report explaining why manual intervention is needed:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains UNSAFE\n```\n\n### Example: With Error Handling\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: deploy-with-rollback\n\nDeploy changes with automatic rollback on failure.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **environment** (required): Target environment (staging, production)\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Run Tests\nRun the full test suite. Report any failures.\n\n### 2. Deploy\nDeploy to {{input.environment}}.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 3. Verify\nVerify the deployment is healthy.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 4. Rollback\nRoll back to the previous version and report what went wrong.\n\n## Output\n\nDeployment to {{input.environment}} complete.\n{{Verify}}\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Variables:** Use `{{input.name}}` for inputs and `{{Step Name}}` for outputs from previous steps.\n\n**Conditions:** Add `**Condition:**` to make a step run only when the condition is true. Common patterns:\n- `{{Step Name}} contains X` - check if output contains text\n- `{{Step Name}} not empty` - check if output exists\n- `{{input.flag}} equals yes` - check exact value\n\n**Error handling:** Add `**On error:**` to control what happens when a step fails:\n- `stop` (default) - halt the workflow\n- `continue` - log the error and move to the next step\n- `Step Name` - jump to a specific step (useful for cleanup/rollback)\n\n**Output:** The `## Output` section defines the final result. If omitted, the last step's output is used.\n\n## Designing Workflows\n\nWhen asked to create a workflow, DO NOT start writing it immediately. Follow this process:\n\n### Phase 1: Understand\n\n1. Use TodoWrite to create a plan for designing the workflow (e.g., \"Gather requirements\", \"Identify inputs and edge cases\", \"Draft workflow\", \"Write to file\", \"Present for review\").\n2. Ask clarifying questions before doing anything else. You need to understand:\n    - What the workflow should accomplish end-to-end\n    - What triggers it and what the expected outcome is\n    - What inputs/variables are needed\n    - What external services or tools are involved\n    - How errors should be handled (stop? retry? rollback?)\n    - How often this will run and in what contexts\n3. **Wait for answers. Do not proceed until you have enough information to design a good workflow.** Do not guess or assume â ask.\n\n### Phase 2: Draft \u0026 Save\n\n4. Once you understand the requirements, draft the workflow.\n5. Write it to `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n6. Mark your design todos as complete.\n\n### Phase 3: Hand Off\n\n7. Present the workflow to the user with a brief summary of what each step does.\n8. Ask the user to review it. Offer to make changes.\n9. **Offer to execute the workflow â do NOT execute it automatically.** Say something like: \"Want me to run this now, or would you like to make changes first?\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Never skip Phase 1. Never jump straight to writing. Never auto-execute after designing.\n\nUse descriptive step names in title case (e.g., \"Fetch Issues\" not \"step1\") â these become variables for later steps.\n\nFor deterministic operations (data transformation, calculations), consider having steps use Python scripts (see `python-scripts` skill). For external services (Slack, Jira, databases), consider MCP servers (see `mcp-curl` skill).\n\n## Executing Workflows\n\nUsers may ask to run a workflow at any time â not just immediately after designing one. Workflows in `workflows/` are persistent, reusable artifacts. A user might say \"run the code-review workflow\" days or weeks after it was created. Treat execution as a standalone operation: load the file, collect inputs, and run it. Don't assume you have any prior context about the workflow beyond what's in the file itself.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If the user asks you to *create* a workflow, do NOT auto-execute it after writing the file. Present it for review and offer to run it. But if the user asks you to *run* an existing workflow, go ahead â that's an explicit request.\n\nWhen the user asks you to run a workflow:\n\n1. Load the workflow from `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n2. Use TodoWrite to create a todo for each workflow step before you begin. This is your execution plan â the user will follow along.\n3. **Present the execution plan to the user.** After creating the todos, present a brief summary of what will be executed and ask the user to confirm before proceeding. For example: \"I've planned the following steps: [list steps]. Does this look good to proceed?\"\n4. **Wait for user approval.** Do not begin execution until the user confirms.\n5. Collect any required inputs from the user. If inputs are missing and have no defaults, ask for them.\n6. Execute each step in order:\n    - Check conditions before running conditional steps.\n    - Interpolate variables (`{{input.name}}` and `{{Step Name}}`).\n    - Follow error handling directives.\n    - Mark each todo complete/failed/skipped as you go.\n7. Provide running updates in normal chat messages as you work through each step. If errors occur, judgment calls are needed, or unexpected conditions arise, mention them in chat and add new todos as needed.\n\nComplete tasks fully, follow requested formats exactly, and provide specific analysis rather than vague summaries.\n\nAfter execution, write a brief summary to `workflows/.runs/` noting what succeeded, failed, or was skipped. Report results to the user using the workflow's Output section if present.\n\n## Improving Workflows\n\nAfter executing a workflow, you can analyze the execution and propose improvements to the workflow file.\n\n**What to look for:**\n- Steps that needed retries or failed â unclear prompt? missing format spec?\n- Steps that produced poor output â missing context? too vague?\n- Steps that should be split into smaller steps\n- Missing error handling for steps that failed\n- Hardcoded values that should be inputs\n\n**Process:** Review which steps succeeded/failed/retried and what fixes were applied. For each issue, determine the concrete fix (rewrite prompt, add format spec, split step, add error handling, etc.). Present each proposed change with the issue, current text, and proposed text.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Get user approval before editing the workflow file. Never apply changes automatically.\n\n**Example:**\n```\n## Proposed Changes to issue-triage.md\n\n### 1. Step: Analyze Issues\n**Issue:** Agent returned prose instead of JSON. Had to retry.\n**Change:** Add explicit format requirement.\n\nCurrent:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e Return the results as JSON.\n\nProposed:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e\n\u003e Return as a JSON array:\n\u003e [{\"number\": 1, \"title\": \"...\", \"priority\": \"High|Medium|Low\", \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n\nApply these changes? (yes/no/select specific)\n```\n\nDon't change things that worked fine or add complexity without a concrete problem to solve.","type":"text"}]},"type":"tool"},{"arguments":"{\"query\":\"web search\"}","callID":"toolu_01KJMjY5NgmgjmoH6JtLSuER","id":"msg_01EpCFsq4yMdnrLZhs8ReTKS-2","name":"obot_search_mcp_servers","output":{"content":[{"text":"{\"catalog_entries\":[{\"id\":\"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae\",\"name\":\"Exa Search\",\"description\":\"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction\",\"runtime\":\"containerized\",\"type\":\"catalog_entry\",\"requires_configuration\":true,\"needs_url\":false}],\"multi_user_servers\":[],\"total_count\":1,\"query\":\"web search\"}","type":"text"}],"structuredContent":{"catalog_entries":[{"description":"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction","id":"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae","name":"Exa Search","needs_url":false,"requires_configuration":true,"runtime":"containerized","type":"catalog_entry"}],"multi_user_servers":[],"query":"web search","total_count":1}},"type":"tool"}],"role":"assistant"}

Each step's output can be referenced by later steps using `{{Step Name}}`.\n\n## When to Use Workflows\n\nWorkflows are for repeatable tasks. If it's a one-time thing, just execute it directly.\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\nUse TodoWrite during **both** workflow design and execution. The user sees your todo list â it's your primary way of keeping them informed.\n\n- **When designing:** Create todos for your design steps (gather requirements, identify inputs/edge cases, draft workflow, write file, present for review).\n- **When executing:** Create a todo for each workflow step and update status as you go. Add new todos if unexpected issues arise.\n\nKeep todo titles short and scannable. Update them as you progress â don't leave stale todos sitting around.\n\n## Workflow Format\n\nWorkflows are Markdown files with:\n- **Title**: `# Workflow: workflow-name`\n- **Description**: Brief explanation of the workflow's purpose\n- **Inputs**: Optional parameters with defaults\n- **Steps**: Numbered steps with clear instructions\n- **Output**: Optional template for the final result\n\n### Example: Simple Review\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: code-review\n\nReview code changes for quality issues.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **target** (optional): Files to review. Default: `.`\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Find Changes\nFind all modified code files in {{input.target}}.\n\n### 2. Review Code\nReview these files for quality issues:\n{{Find Changes}}\n\nFocus on: error handling, edge cases, and readability.\n\n## Output\n\n{{Review Code}}\n```\n\n### Example: With Conditions\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: smart-fix\n\nAnalyze an issue and apply a fix only if it's safe to do so.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Analyze Issue\nAnalyze the reported issue and determine severity.\n\n### 2. Check Safety\nBased on this analysis, determine if an automated fix is safe:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\nEnd your response with SAFE or UNSAFE.\n\n### 3. Apply Fix\nApply the fix for: {{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains SAFE\n\n### 4. Create Manual Report\nCreate a report explaining why manual intervention is needed:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains UNSAFE\n```\n\n### Example: With Error Handling\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: deploy-with-rollback\n\nDeploy changes with automatic rollback on failure.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **environment** (required): Target environment (staging, production)\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Run Tests\nRun the full test suite. Report any failures.\n\n### 2. Deploy\nDeploy to {{input.environment}}.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 3. Verify\nVerify the deployment is healthy.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 4. Rollback\nRoll back to the previous version and report what went wrong.\n\n## Output\n\nDeployment to {{input.environment}} complete.\n{{Verify}}\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Variables:** Use `{{input.name}}` for inputs and `{{Step Name}}` for outputs from previous steps.\n\n**Conditions:** Add `**Condition:**` to make a step run only when the condition is true. Common patterns:\n- `{{Step Name}} contains X` - check if output contains text\n- `{{Step Name}} not empty` - check if output exists\n- `{{input.flag}} equals yes` - check exact value\n\n**Error handling:** Add `**On error:**` to control what happens when a step fails:\n- `stop` (default) - halt the workflow\n- `continue` - log the error and move to the next step\n- `Step Name` - jump to a specific step (useful for cleanup/rollback)\n\n**Output:** The `## Output` section defines the final result. If omitted, the last step's output is used.\n\n## Designing Workflows\n\nWhen asked to create a workflow, DO NOT start writing it immediately. Follow this process:\n\n### Phase 1: Understand\n\n1. Use TodoWrite to create a plan for designing the workflow (e.g., \"Gather requirements\", \"Identify inputs and edge cases\", \"Draft workflow\", \"Write to file\", \"Present for review\").\n2. Ask clarifying questions before doing anything else. You need to understand:\n    - What the workflow should accomplish end-to-end\n    - What triggers it and what the expected outcome is\n    - What inputs/variables are needed\n    - What external services or tools are involved\n    - How errors should be handled (stop? retry? rollback?)\n    - How often this will run and in what contexts\n3. **Wait for answers. Do not proceed until you have enough information to design a good workflow.** Do not guess or assume â ask.\n\n### Phase 2: Draft \u0026 Save\n\n4. Once you understand the requirements, draft the workflow.\n5. Write it to `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n6. Mark your design todos as complete.\n\n### Phase 3: Hand Off\n\n7. Present the workflow to the user with a brief summary of what each step does.\n8. Ask the user to review it. Offer to make changes.\n9. **Offer to execute the workflow â do NOT execute it automatically.** Say something like: \"Want me to run this now, or would you like to make changes first?\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Never skip Phase 1. Never jump straight to writing. Never auto-execute after designing.\n\nUse descriptive step names in title case (e.g., \"Fetch Issues\" not \"step1\") â these become variables for later steps.\n\nFor deterministic operations (data transformation, calculations), consider having steps use Python scripts (see `python-scripts` skill). For external services (Slack, Jira, databases), consider MCP servers (see `mcp-curl` skill).\n\n## Executing Workflows\n\nUsers may ask to run a workflow at any time â not just immediately after designing one. Workflows in `workflows/` are persistent, reusable artifacts. A user might say \"run the code-review workflow\" days or weeks after it was created. Treat execution as a standalone operation: load the file, collect inputs, and run it. Don't assume you have any prior context about the workflow beyond what's in the file itself.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If the user asks you to *create* a workflow, do NOT auto-execute it after writing the file. Present it for review and offer to run it. But if the user asks you to *run* an existing workflow, go ahead â that's an explicit request.\n\nWhen the user asks you to run a workflow:\n\n1. Load the workflow from `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n2. Use TodoWrite to create a todo for each workflow step before you begin. This is your execution plan â the user will follow along.\n3. **Present the execution plan to the user.** After creating the todos, present a brief summary of what will be executed and ask the user to confirm before proceeding. For example: \"I've planned the following steps: [list steps]. Does this look good to proceed?\"\n4. **Wait for user approval.** Do not begin execution until the user confirms.\n5. Collect any required inputs from the user. If inputs are missing and have no defaults, ask for them.\n6. Execute each step in order:\n    - Check conditions before running conditional steps.\n    - Interpolate variables (`{{input.name}}` and `{{Step Name}}`).\n    - Follow error handling directives.\n    - Mark each todo complete/failed/skipped as you go.\n7. Provide running updates in normal chat messages as you work through each step. If errors occur, judgment calls are needed, or unexpected conditions arise, mention them in chat and add new todos as needed.\n\nComplete tasks fully, follow requested formats exactly, and provide specific analysis rather than vague summaries.\n\nAfter execution, write a brief summary to `workflows/.runs/` noting what succeeded, failed, or was skipped. Report results to the user using the workflow's Output section if present.\n\n## Improving Workflows\n\nAfter executing a workflow, you can analyze the execution and propose improvements to the workflow file.\n\n**What to look for:**\n- Steps that needed retries or failed â unclear prompt? missing format spec?\n- Steps that produced poor output â missing context? too vague?\n- Steps that should be split into smaller steps\n- Missing error handling for steps that failed\n- Hardcoded values that should be inputs\n\n**Process:** Review which steps succeeded/failed/retried and what fixes were applied. For each issue, determine the concrete fix (rewrite prompt, add format spec, split step, add error handling, etc.). Present each proposed change with the issue, current text, and proposed text.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Get user approval before editing the workflow file. Never apply changes automatically.\n\n**Example:**\n```\n## Proposed Changes to issue-triage.md\n\n### 1. Step: Analyze Issues\n**Issue:** Agent returned prose instead of JSON. Had to retry.\n**Change:** Add explicit format requirement.\n\nCurrent:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e Return the results as JSON.\n\nProposed:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e\n\u003e Return as a JSON array:\n\u003e [{\"number\": 1, \"title\": \"...\", \"priority\": \"High|Medium|Low\", \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n\nApply these changes? (yes/no/select specific)\n```\n\nDon't change things that worked fine or add complexity without a concrete problem to solve.","type":"text"}]},"type":"tool"},{"arguments":"{\"query\":\"web search\"}","callID":"toolu_01KJMjY5NgmgjmoH6JtLSuER","id":"msg_01EpCFsq4yMdnrLZhs8ReTKS-2","name":"obot_search_mcp_servers","output":{"content":[{"text":"{\"catalog_entries\":[{\"id\":\"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae\",\"name\":\"Exa Search\",\"description\":\"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction\",\"runtime\":\"containerized\",\"type\":\"catalog_entry\",\"requires_configuration\":true,\"needs_url\":false}],\"multi_user_servers\":[],\"total_count\":1,\"query\":\"web search\"}","type":"text"}],"structuredContent":{"catalog_entries":[{"description":"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction","id":"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae","name":"Exa Search","needs_url":false,"requires_configuration":true,"runtime":"containerized","type":"catalog_entry"}],"multi_user_servers":[],"query":"web search","total_count":1}},"type":"tool"}],"role":"assistant"}

Each step's output can be referenced by later steps using `{{Step Name}}`.\n\n## When to Use Workflows\n\nWorkflows are for repeatable tasks. If it's a one-time thing, just execute it directly.\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\nUse TodoWrite during **both** workflow design and execution. The user sees your todo list â it's your primary way of keeping them informed.\n\n- **When designing:** Create todos for your design steps (gather requirements, identify inputs/edge cases, draft workflow, write file, present for review).\n- **When executing:** Create a todo for each workflow step and update status as you go. Add new todos if unexpected issues arise.\n\nKeep todo titles short and scannable. Update them as you progress â don't leave stale todos sitting around.\n\n## Workflow Format\n\nWorkflows are Markdown files with:\n- **Title**: `# Workflow: workflow-name`\n- **Description**: Brief explanation of the workflow's purpose\n- **Inputs**: Optional parameters with defaults\n- **Steps**: Numbered steps with clear instructions\n- **Output**: Optional template for the final result\n\n### Example: Simple Review\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: code-review\n\nReview code changes for quality issues.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **target** (optional): Files to review. Default: `.`\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Find Changes\nFind all modified code files in {{input.target}}.\n\n### 2. Review Code\nReview these files for quality issues:\n{{Find Changes}}\n\nFocus on: error handling, edge cases, and readability.\n\n## Output\n\n{{Review Code}}\n```\n\n### Example: With Conditions\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: smart-fix\n\nAnalyze an issue and apply a fix only if it's safe to do so.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Analyze Issue\nAnalyze the reported issue and determine severity.\n\n### 2. Check Safety\nBased on this analysis, determine if an automated fix is safe:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\nEnd your response with SAFE or UNSAFE.\n\n### 3. Apply Fix\nApply the fix for: {{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains SAFE\n\n### 4. Create Manual Report\nCreate a report explaining why manual intervention is needed:\n{{Analyze Issue}}\n\n**Condition:** {{Check Safety}} contains UNSAFE\n```\n\n### Example: With Error Handling\n\n```markdown\n# Workflow: deploy-with-rollback\n\nDeploy changes with automatic rollback on failure.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **environment** (required): Target environment (staging, production)\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Run Tests\nRun the full test suite. Report any failures.\n\n### 2. Deploy\nDeploy to {{input.environment}}.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 3. Verify\nVerify the deployment is healthy.\n\n**On error:** Rollback\n\n### 4. Rollback\nRoll back to the previous version and report what went wrong.\n\n## Output\n\nDeployment to {{input.environment}} complete.\n{{Verify}}\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Variables:** Use `{{input.name}}` for inputs and `{{Step Name}}` for outputs from previous steps.\n\n**Conditions:** Add `**Condition:**` to make a step run only when the condition is true. Common patterns:\n- `{{Step Name}} contains X` - check if output contains text\n- `{{Step Name}} not empty` - check if output exists\n- `{{input.flag}} equals yes` - check exact value\n\n**Error handling:** Add `**On error:**` to control what happens when a step fails:\n- `stop` (default) - halt the workflow\n- `continue` - log the error and move to the next step\n- `Step Name` - jump to a specific step (useful for cleanup/rollback)\n\n**Output:** The `## Output` section defines the final result. If omitted, the last step's output is used.\n\n## Designing Workflows\n\nWhen asked to create a workflow, DO NOT start writing it immediately. Follow this process:\n\n### Phase 1: Understand\n\n1. Use TodoWrite to create a plan for designing the workflow (e.g., \"Gather requirements\", \"Identify inputs and edge cases\", \"Draft workflow\", \"Write to file\", \"Present for review\").\n2. Ask clarifying questions before doing anything else. You need to understand:\n    - What the workflow should accomplish end-to-end\n    - What triggers it and what the expected outcome is\n    - What inputs/variables are needed\n    - What external services or tools are involved\n    - How errors should be handled (stop? retry? rollback?)\n    - How often this will run and in what contexts\n3. **Wait for answers. Do not proceed until you have enough information to design a good workflow.** Do not guess or assume â ask.\n\n### Phase 2: Draft \u0026 Save\n\n4. Once you understand the requirements, draft the workflow.\n5. Write it to `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n6. Mark your design todos as complete.\n\n### Phase 3: Hand Off\n\n7. Present the workflow to the user with a brief summary of what each step does.\n8. Ask the user to review it. Offer to make changes.\n9. **Offer to execute the workflow â do NOT execute it automatically.** Say something like: \"Want me to run this now, or would you like to make changes first?\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Never skip Phase 1. Never jump straight to writing. Never auto-execute after designing.\n\nUse descriptive step names in title case (e.g., \"Fetch Issues\" not \"step1\") â these become variables for later steps.\n\nFor deterministic operations (data transformation, calculations), consider having steps use Python scripts (see `python-scripts` skill). For external services (Slack, Jira, databases), consider MCP servers (see `mcp-curl` skill).\n\n## Executing Workflows\n\nUsers may ask to run a workflow at any time â not just immediately after designing one. Workflows in `workflows/` are persistent, reusable artifacts. A user might say \"run the code-review workflow\" days or weeks after it was created. Treat execution as a standalone operation: load the file, collect inputs, and run it. Don't assume you have any prior context about the workflow beyond what's in the file itself.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If the user asks you to *create* a workflow, do NOT auto-execute it after writing the file. Present it for review and offer to run it. But if the user asks you to *run* an existing workflow, go ahead â that's an explicit request.\n\nWhen the user asks you to run a workflow:\n\n1. Load the workflow from `workflows/\u003cname\u003e.md`.\n2. Use TodoWrite to create a todo for each workflow step before you begin. This is your execution plan â the user will follow along.\n3. **Present the execution plan to the user.** After creating the todos, present a brief summary of what will be executed and ask the user to confirm before proceeding. For example: \"I've planned the following steps: [list steps]. Does this look good to proceed?\"\n4. **Wait for user approval.** Do not begin execution until the user confirms.\n5. Collect any required inputs from the user. If inputs are missing and have no defaults, ask for them.\n6. Execute each step in order:\n    - Check conditions before running conditional steps.\n    - Interpolate variables (`{{input.name}}` and `{{Step Name}}`).\n    - Follow error handling directives.\n    - Mark each todo complete/failed/skipped as you go.\n7. Provide running updates in normal chat messages as you work through each step. If errors occur, judgment calls are needed, or unexpected conditions arise, mention them in chat and add new todos as needed.\n\nComplete tasks fully, follow requested formats exactly, and provide specific analysis rather than vague summaries.\n\nAfter execution, write a brief summary to `workflows/.runs/` noting what succeeded, failed, or was skipped. Report results to the user using the workflow's Output section if present.\n\n## Improving Workflows\n\nAfter executing a workflow, you can analyze the execution and propose improvements to the workflow file.\n\n**What to look for:**\n- Steps that needed retries or failed â unclear prompt? missing format spec?\n- Steps that produced poor output â missing context? too vague?\n- Steps that should be split into smaller steps\n- Missing error handling for steps that failed\n- Hardcoded values that should be inputs\n\n**Process:** Review which steps succeeded/failed/retried and what fixes were applied. For each issue, determine the concrete fix (rewrite prompt, add format spec, split step, add error handling, etc.). Present each proposed change with the issue, current text, and proposed text.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Get user approval before editing the workflow file. Never apply changes automatically.\n\n**Example:**\n```\n## Proposed Changes to issue-triage.md\n\n### 1. Step: Analyze Issues\n**Issue:** Agent returned prose instead of JSON. Had to retry.\n**Change:** Add explicit format requirement.\n\nCurrent:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e Return the results as JSON.\n\nProposed:\n\u003e Analyze each issue and categorize by priority.\n\u003e\n\u003e Return as a JSON array:\n\u003e [{\"number\": 1, \"title\": \"...\", \"priority\": \"High|Medium|Low\", \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n\nApply these changes? (yes/no/select specific)\n```\n\nDon't change things that worked fine or add complexity without a concrete problem to solve.","type":"text"}]},"type":"tool"},{"arguments":"{\"query\":\"web search\"}","callID":"toolu_01KJMjY5NgmgjmoH6JtLSuER","id":"msg_01EpCFsq4yMdnrLZhs8ReTKS-2","name":"obot_search_mcp_servers","output":{"content":[{"text":"{\"catalog_entries\":[{\"id\":\"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae\",\"name\":\"Exa Search\",\"description\":\"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction\",\"runtime\":\"containerized\",\"type\":\"catalog_entry\",\"requires_configuration\":true,\"needs_url\":false}],\"multi_user_servers\":[],\"total_count\":1,\"query\":\"web search\"}","type":"text"}],"structuredContent":{"catalog_entries":[{"description":"AI-powered web search for research, company intelligence, and content extraction","id":"default-exa-search-ee44b5ae","name":"Exa Search","needs_url":false,"requires_configuration":true,"runtime":"containerized","type":"catalog_entry"}],"multi_user_servers":[],"query":"web search","total_count":1}},"type":"tool"}],"role":"assistant"}

hundreds of engineering leaders about AI in software testing. Different industries. Different company sizes. Different levels of maturity.\n\nBut the same concerns kept coming up. Which tools actually work? How do we integrate AI without disrupting existing workflows? Are teams seeing real returns, or is this still mostly experimentation?\n\nTo find out, we surveyed more than 250 CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and QA leaders across the US, UK, and Europe. The result is [**The State of AI in Software Testing 2026**](https://www.browserstack.com/state-of-art-software-testing-report?utm_source=company-blog\u0026utm_medium=PR\u0026utm_platform=\u0026utm_content=featured-content\u0026utm_campaign=PR-State-of-AI-testing-report\u0026utm_campaigncode=701OW00000gO0rXYAS\u0026utm_term=company-blog)**,** a detailed look at how teams are adopting AI, where theyâre succeeding, and where theyâre getting stuck.\n\n![BrowserStackâs State of AI in Software Testing 2026 report reveals how teams worldwide are integrating AI into their testing and QA processes.](https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-09-at-6.04.14---AM-1.png)\n\n## What the Data Actually Shows\n\nHere's what jumped out from our research: 61 percent of organizations already use AI across most of their testing workflows. Meanwhile, 18 percent are seeing returns over 100 percent. But higher spending alone doesnât guarantee stronger returns. It's coming from teams that made more disciplined implementation choices about how they approached AI adoption.\n\n### Why Some Teams Pull Ahead\n\nWhen we compared high-performing teams with the rest of the market, clear patterns emerged:\n\n- First, tool selection matters more than tool sophistication. Organizations seeing the strongest returns consistently prioritized integration.\n- Second, integration remains the biggest obstacle. Across industries and regions, 37 percent of teams cited connecting AI tools with existing workflows as their top challenge. Budget constraints ranked fifth at 32 percent. For most teams, the barrier is operational, not financial.\n- Third, where early wins really come from. The strongest initial results arenât driven by flashy experiments. They come from a small set of core testing workflows where AI quietly delivers speed and stability.\n- Fourth, maturity compounds results. Organizations that have been using AI in testing for more than four years are 83 percent more likely to achieve over 100 percent ROI. Early gains tend to come from automation and efficiency. Long-term returns come from system-level adoption.\n\n*âToo many teams think adopting AI is the finish line, when itâs really the starting point,â said Nakul Aggarwal, Co-founder and CTO of BrowserStack. âThe real work is integrating it into everyday workflows, training teams to use it well, and building systems that scale. Thatâs what separates meaningful progress from surface-level automation.â*\n\n[Read the Full Report!](https://www.browserstack.com/state-of-art-software-testing-report?utm_source=company-blog\u0026utm_medium=PR\u0026utm_platform=\u0026utm_content=featured-content\u0026utm_campaign=PR-State-of-AI-testing-report\u0026utm_campaigncode=701OW00000gO0rXYAS\u0026utm_term=company-blog)\n\n## What's Inside the Full Report\n\n[The State of AI in Software Testing 2026](https://www.browserstack.com/state-of-art-software-testing-report?utm_source=company-blog\u0026utm_medium=PR\u0026utm_platform=\u0026utm_content=featured-content\u0026utm_campaign=PR-State-of-AI-testing-report\u0026utm_campaigncode=701OW00000gO0rXYAS\u0026utm_term=company-blog) goes beyond trends and predictions. It's a practical roadmap built from real implementation experiences:\n\n#### The Landscape\n\n- Adoption patterns across company sizes, industries, and regions\n- Which application types are seeing the most AI testing\n- Key areas where AI is being deployed, and which ones deliver the fastest wins\n\n#### Implementation Strategy\n\n- How teams address integration, security, and reliability challenges\n- Security and privacy approaches that actually work\n- The automation maturity scale, and where you probably are on it\n\n#### The Future\n\n- Budget allocation trends for 2026 (88 percent are increasing spending, here's where that money is going)\n- How AI will change testing workflows over the next 1â2 years\n- What QA professionals should be learning right now\n\n#### Regional \u0026 Industry Insights\n\n- Why US and UK teams are adopting differently than mainland Europe\n- How financial services and manufacturing approach AI testing\n- What large enterprises do differently (and why it matters)\n\n\u003e âThe next phase of AI in testing isnât about adding more tools, itâs about eliminating the seams between them. Teams today bounce between multiple tools to understand test health, debug failures, and prioritize what to fix. Within two years, that fragmentation disappears - AI will connect whatâs breaking, why it matters, and how to fix it, all in the context of your actual delivery goals. The teams that win will be those who stop asking âwhat can AI do?â and start asking âwhat should humans stop doing?ââ\n\n[**Dhimil Gosalia**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhimil/?ref=browserstack.com)**, VP of Product,** [**BrowserStack**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/browserstack?ref=browserstack.com)\n\n*The State of AI in Software Testing 2026 explores how leading teams are answering that question in practice.

Explore the best AI-powered testing tools of 2026 â and why Sauce Labs stands out.*Â \n\n![quote](/images/green-saucebot.svg)\n\nModern software teams face mounting pressures, from compressed release cycles to increasingly stringent quality expectations. Applications have become sprawling ecosystems with countless moving parts. Testing all of this manually? Thatâs no longer realistic, so AI-based test automation tools have moved from ânice to haveâ to mission critical.Â \n\nAs we navigate 2026, artificial intelligence has evolved beyond a mere buzzword and into the backbone of the modern testing life cycle. AI testing tools execute tests faster than humans can click through interfaces, fundamentally reshaping quality engineering by learning from billions of test executions and surfacing insights that would take hours of manual investigation to uncover.Â \n\nThis guide examines the leading AI automation testing platforms available today. Whether youâre an SDET managing thousands of test cases, a platform engineer building CI/CD pipelines, or a CTO evaluating quality infrastructure investments, youâll find detailed breakdowns of what actually works in production environments.Â \n\n## What are AI-powered automation testing tools?\n\nAI test automation tools leverage machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and intelligent analytics to automate software testing workflows, improving how tests are created, executed, maintained, and analyzed.Â \n\nInstead of relying on rigid, rule-based automation scripts, these platforms âlearnâ from application behavior and testing patterns to âunderstandâ the application under test and the testing process. At a practical level, the AI component manifests in several ways, helping teams automate faster, reduce flaky tests, and spend less time maintaining test suites.Â \n\nAI can now parse requirements documents and automatically create optimized test scenarios. It can also generate realistic test data, eliminating the need for manual data creation to expand the scope of testing scenarios within an application. By analyzing vast amounts of historical execution data and how real users interact with an application, intelligent analytics systems can correlate failures across thousands of test runs to identify root causes and better simulate common user journeys and workflows.Â \n\nPlus, visual comparison algorithms distinguish meaningful UI regressions from acceptable variations. Even better, AI can speed up automated test development, making the test creation process more intuitive and easier for those without an engineering background. Perhaps best of all, adapting and updating tests as products change helps AI systems ensure continuous testing coverage.Â \n\nAs applications become more dynamic and distributed, teams that want scalable, reliable quality at speed are turning to AI-based test automation tools.Â \n\n## Key benefits of AI in automation testing\n\nAI transforms testing from a bottleneck into an accelerator. Teams implementing these tools report substantial improvements:\n\n- **Test creation speed increases dramatically**. Engineers describe work that previously took days â writing, maintaining, and fixing tests â now completing in hours. With AI-driven automation, teams can generate reusable, maintainable end-to-end test cases from plain English descriptions or even [design mockups](https://saucelabs.com/resources/blog/from-design-to-deployed-introducing-the-figma-plugin-for-sauce-visual) in seconds.\n- **Coverage expands without proportional headcount increases**. AI systems can generate edge cases that humans often overlook, testing permutations and scenarios that would be impractical to write manually. Teams running parallel tests across hundreds of browser and device combinations find that the coverage ceiling effectively disappears, empowering them to focus their efforts where they matter most.\n- **Enhanced bug detection**: AI doesn't just check for âpass/failâ based on a script. Instead, these platforms look for anomalies in visual layouts and system performance that could indicate a deeper issue.\n- **AI-powered low-code and no-code platforms democratize the testing process**. Through natural language processing (NLP), non-technical team members can create and execute automated tests using plain English instructions.\n- **Quality insights become actionable**. Rather than drowning in test reports, teams get natural language summaries explaining what failed, why it matters, and what to do next. Dashboards surface trends before they become crises so that human testers can focus on more strategic activities.\n\nWhile the high-level benefits of AI are undeniable, achieving these results in a production environment requires moving beyond the hype. To realize a true return on investment, engineering leaders must evaluate tools against a specific set of technical and operational benchmarks.\n\n## What to look for in AI automation testing tools\n\nNot all âAI-poweredâ testing tools are created equal. Evaluating these platforms requires looking beyond marketing claims about features and considering what separates truly intelligent tools from traditional automation with an AI wrapper.\n\n**Genuine AI-driven test generation matters**. Can the platform create meaningful tests from natural language descriptions, requirements documents, or user stories? Does it understand context and generate realistic test data? The best solutions combine multiple AI approaches rather than relying on a single technique.Â \n\n**Testing scope determines usefulness**. The platform should handle your application types: web, mobile, desktop applications. Cross-browser and cross-device testing at scale separates enterprise-grade solutions from niche tools.Â \n\n**Integration depth affects adoption**. Seamless connections to CI/CD pipelines, test management systems, issue trackers, and collaboration platforms reduce friction. The best tools inject insights directly into developer workflows rather than requiring context switching to separate dashboards.\n\n**Performance and reliability scale with your needs**. Parallel execution across hundreds or thousands of concurrent tests, infrastructure that handles peak loads without degradation, and enterprise-grade security and compliance certifications become critical as usage grows.\n\n**Pricing models should align with value delivery**. Consumption-based pricing offers flexibility for teams with variable testing needs. Subscription models work better for predictable, high-volume scenarios. Watch for hidden costs in device minutes, test executions, or user seats.Â \n\nEquipped with the right criteria, the next step is identifying which tools actually deliver on the promise of autonomous testing.\n\n## Top 10 automation testing tools in 2026\n\n![Stylized isometric illustration of a green and white mechanical device with gears and conveyor belt next to \"Sauce Labs\" text.](https://images.ctfassets.net/vrc8wif0t20g/6jEpFrHWfCInZxZ6nh38Fn/b18a8a98081be2271bcacd90a2dd1196/SauceLabs.png?fm=webp\u0026q=90)\n\n### 1.

In October 2025, we brought together over 1,000 quality engineering leaders, practitioners, and innovators for Transform, our annual conference exploring whatâs next in software delivery. Across all expert-led sessions, keynotes from industry pioneers, and real-world success stories, we saw the trends defining 2026: AI-driven quality engineering is happening now, and itâs redefining whatâs possible at scale.\n\nWhether you joined us in person or are [tuning in now](/conference-highlights/transform-2025), Transform 2025 was the definitive event for discovering the insights and trends that are shaping the next era of software quality.\n\n## AI is significantly expanding the surface area for business risk\n\nIn the [opening keynote](/resources/kevin-thompson-executive-keynote-transform2025), Tricentis CEO Kevin Thompson emphasized that over 40% of code written last year was generated by AI. However, we have far less data on how much of this code survived review and made it into production. The confidence gap is real: in a Stack Overflow survey, 88% of respondents said they werenât confident deploying AI-generated code, while a GitLab survey found that 29% had to roll back releases due to AI errors. This accelerating pace of change demands a fundamental shift in how teams work, marking software quality engineeringâs entry into a new AI-driven era.\n\nTo address this gap, Tricentis has developed AI agents that create tests autonomously, self-drive execution, problem-solve, and deliver results.\n\nDavid Colwell, VP of AI, and Eran Sher, Chief Product Officer at Tricentis, shared what Tricentis is building to meet these emerging needs:\n\n- **Agentic test generation** creates complete test cases from natural language prompts, user stories, or requirements â dramatically reducing manual authoring effort.\n- **Agentic quality intelligence** continuously analyzes code changes and coverage to identify testing gaps, then automatically generates tests to close them.\n- **Agentic load testing** builds sophisticated load test scenarios with realistic user behavior patterns.\n- **A conversational testing interface** ties it all together, letting teams interact with all agentic capabilities through intuitive, chat-based tools that make AI-powered testing accessible to everyone on the team.\n\nThese innovations signal Tricentisâs commitment to not just keeping pace with AIâs disruption of software development, but actively solving the quality challenges it creates.\n\n## QA is becoming an accountability layer for AI\n\nWhen AI fails, it fails at enterprise scale. A central takeaway from Transform this year was how quality assurance is becoming the critical accountability layer for AI-driven software delivery.\n\nWhere QA teams once wrote scripts and ran tests, they now define quality objectives, oversee AI-generated results, and ensure automated decisions align with business priorities. This shift reflects lessons from the field: AI projects fail not because of the technology itself, but because of poor data, adoption challenges, and scalability issues, areas where domain expertise proves essential. Modern QA teams are building closed-loop AI systems where agents can author, execute, and analyze tests autonomously, but with human oversight providing the governance needed to keep these systems reliable, scalable, and aligned with real-world needs. In this new paradigm, QA isnât just testing software, but validating the AI thatâs increasingly building and testing that software.\n\n## Human-in-the-loop is non-negotiable\n\nOne theme echoed across many sessions at Transform: AI is probabilistic, not deterministic. This is a fundamental difference that changes everything about how we deploy it. Scaling AI without proper governance doesnât just create risk; it leads to systemic failures that can undermine entire initiatives. The numbers tell the story: 95% of AI pilots fail due to lack of appropriate guardrails, with 60% of those failures involving compliance issues that could have been prevented.\n\nThe path forward requires a deliberate strategy built on clear KPIs, continuous monitoring that treats AI systems as living processes rather than one-time implementations, and parallel testing to validate AI decisions against established benchmarks. In an era where AI can transform quality engineering at unprecedented speed, the organizations that succeed will be those that build human oversight into the foundation as a core principle.\n\n## Early AI adopters are pulling ahead\n\nÂ \n\nIn a session about [setting the workforce training agenda](/resources/ai-training-for-your-workforce-transform2025), Sophia Velastegui, former Chief AI Officer at Microsoft, put it bluntly: âThis is the smallest gap right now between people who know AI and donât. But that gap is going to get bigger.â In the same session, Vittorio Cretella, former CIO of Procter \u0026 Gamble, was even more direct: âYouâre going to lose your job to AI if you donât learn to use AI.â\n\nThe path forward isnât about fearing displacement; itâs about seizing the opportunity to lead. Organizations and individuals who demonstrate tangible business value with AI, who lead by example rather than waiting for permission, and who embrace change as a competitive advantage are the ones who will define the next decade of software quality. The question isnât whether to adopt AI, but whether youâll be among those who shape how itâs used.\n\n## The role of QA is fundamentally changing\n\nFor decades, QA professionals have been the executors: writing scripts, running tests, and manually validating results. That era is ending ([catch our recent webinar on how QA is changing here](/resources/your-qa-job-is-changing)).\n\nTodayâs QA leaders are becoming orchestrators, defining quality objectives and overseeing AI-driven outcomes rather than executing every test themselves. We can already measure the impact of this: One Tricentis customer achieved an 85% reduction in manual effort and a 60% increase in productivity using AI agents. As organizations face an avalanche of AI-generated code, the ability to orchestrate quality at scale rather than test line by line has become the difference between keeping pace and falling behind.\n\n## AI Agents are co-workers, not just tools\n\nNot all AI is created equal, and understanding the difference matters. While AI assistants suggest, recommend, and advise, they donât work for us. But agents do. An AI agent operates as your co-worker, combining memory, reasoning, orchestration, and instruction to act autonomously on your behalf.\n\nHowever, at least 60% of AI-generated code contains issues that require intervention, demanding entirely new approaches to testing and quality assurance. The organizations that will succeed with agents arenât just those that deploy them, but those that build the guardrails to ensure they deliver reliable, compliant results.\n\n## Maximize risk coverage over test coverage\n\nThe traditional goal of maximizing test coverage is giving way to something smarter: maximizing risk coverage. Instead of testing everything equally, intelligent orchestration focuses effort where it matters most. This could potentially reduce overall test time by 40% while improving quality outcomes.\n\nThis shift is essential because GenAI testing is inherently probabilistic. Youâll never reach 100% coverage, and chasing it wastes resources that should be directed toward what protects your users and your business. In this new paradigm, edge case testing and exploratory testing become critical disciplines. Identifying the scenarios where AI might fail in unexpected ways and ensuring that risk, not just code, drives your testing strategy.\n\n## Looking to the future\n\nBeyond the frameworks and statistics, some of the most valuable insights at Transform came from leaders whoâve already navigated these transitions. In a session on building enterprise-scale AI processes, Luke Mahon, Product Marketing Director at Tricentis, emphasized the importance of starting small and scaling thoughtfully. In a session on how testers can become agents of change, Nibs Mishra, AVP, Customer Solutions Technology Leader at Nationwide cut to the heart of a common mistake: âDonât throw tools at the problemâ¦bring your workforce with you.â\n\nTom Sweeney, Vice President of Enterprise Technology at Ford, delivered a rallying cry that captured the spirit of the entire conference: âThe faster you adopt, the better off youâll be. Donât be afraidâembrace it.â The path forward requires both courage and strategy, and the organizations and ideas represented at Transform proved that the combination is already happening.\n\nStay tuned for Transform 2026 announcements, and [watch 2025 session recordings here](/conference-highlights/transform-2025).\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbe.tricentis.com%2Fmedia-assets%2F2024%2F05%2Fttmjira-blog-widget.png\u0026w=640\u0026q=75)\n\n### Tricentis testing solutions\n\nLearn how to supercharge your quality engineering journey with our advanced [testing solutions](https://www.tricentis.com).\n\n[Explore products](https://www.tricentis.com/products \"Explore products\")\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=undefined)\n\n[]()[]()\n\nAuthor:\n\n### Sarah Welsh\n\n#### Sr. Content Marketing Specialist\n\nDate: Jan. 05, 2026\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbe.tricentis.com%2Fmedia-assets%2F2024%2F05%2Fttmjira-blog-widget.png\u0026w=640\u0026q=75)\n\n### Tricentis testing solutions\n\nLearn how to supercharge your quality engineering journey with our advanced [testing solutions](https://www.tricentis.com).\n\n[Explore products](https://www.tricentis.com/products \"Explore products\")\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=undefined)\n\n[]()[]()\n\nAuthor:\n\n### Sarah Welsh\n\nDate: Jan. 05, 2026\n\nTopics:\n\n[Artificial intelligence](/blog/category/artificial-intelligence)\n\n#### Recommended\n\n### You might also be interested in...\n\n![Featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbe.tricentis.com%2Fmedia-assets%2F2022%2F08%2FFallback_Research-White-papers.png\u0026w=3840\u0026q=75)\n\n[Reports \u0026 White Papers](/resources)\n\n## [2025 Quality Transformation Report](/resources/quality-transformation-report)\n\nLearn what 2,700 technology practitioners and leaders said about the...\n\n[Read more](/resources/quality-transformation-report \"Read more\")\n\n![Featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbe.tricentis.com%2Fmedia-assets%2F2025%2F10%2Ffeatured-tricentis_transform-resources.png\u0026w=3840\u0026q=75)\n\n[Conference Highlights](/resources)\n\n## [Building a durable career in the age of agentic AI](/resources/building-durable-career-agentic-ai-transform2025)\n\nIn this session, we explore how Agentic AI is changing the rules of...\n\n[Read more](/resources/building-durable-career-agentic-ai-transform2025 \"Read more\")\n\n![Featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbe.tricentis.com%2Fmedia-assets%2F2022%2F08%2FFallback-webinars-conference.png\u0026w=3840\u0026q=75)\n\n[Webinars](/resources)\n\n## [Generative AI in test management: What the evolution of AI means for your Agile testing practice](/resources/generative-ai-test-management)\n\nPierce the buzz around AI and learn how generative AI can take your...\n\n[Read more](/resources/generative-ai-test-management \"Read more\")\n\nCompany\n\n[Careers](/company/careers)[News](/news)[Team](/team)[Partners](/partners)[Trust \u0026 Security](/trust/security)\n\nServices \u0026 Support\n\n[Customer support](https://support-hub.tricentis.com/open)[Product documentation](https://docs.tricentis.com)[Training](/academy)[Transformation toolkit](/transformation)\n\nResources\n\n[Case studies](/case-studies)[eBooks \u0026 Guides](/ebooks-guides)[Webinars \u0026 Videos](/webinars-videos)[Reports \u0026 White Papers](/reports-white-papers)[Blog](/blog)[Learn](/learn)\n\nEvents\n\n[Tricentis Transform 2025](/conference-highlights/transform-2025)[Upcoming webinars](/events)[Public sector events](/solutions/public-sector/calendar)[Recent conference highlights](/conference-highlights)\n\nContact us\n\n[Demos \u0026 Trials](/software-testing-tool-trial-demo)[Locations](/locations)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[](https://twitter.com/Tricentis?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \"Twitter\")[](https://www.facebook.com/TRICENTIS/ \"Facebook\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tricentis-technology-\u0026-consulting-gmbh/ \"Linkedin\")[](https://shiftsync.tricentis.com/ \"Shiftsync\")[](https://www.youtube.com/user/Tricentis \"Youtube\")\n\n[![Tricentis logo](/tricentis-logo.svg)](/)\n\n[Get a demo or trial  \n\\\n![Arrow](/icons/arrow-white.svg)](/software-testing-tool-trial-demo)\n\nSend your testing into overdrive\n\nCopyright Â©2026 Tricentis.

The tools that matter now use agentic testing, video-to-code, and self-healing to replace brittle scripts with intent-based QA. Here are 12 ranked by what holds up in real CI/CD.\n\n* * *\n\n## **The testing tools you picked last year are already outdated**\n\nSelenium is still everywhere. It defined browser automation, and its [WebDriver protocol](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) became a W3C standard. Playwright replaced it technically (using [CDP](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-cdpsession) instead of WebDriver), but Selenium's patterns and mental models still influence how most teams think about test automation. It's not going away. But the layer on top of raw browser protocols is changing fast.\n\nA year ago, most \"AI testing\" tools were wrappers around GPT that generated flaky Cypress scripts. You'd spend an hour cleaning up what the AI produced, then another hour debugging why it failed in CI. *The value proposition was shaky.*\n\n**That's shifted.** The newer tools use vision models that interpret your UI the way a human tester would. They navigate dynamically instead of following hardcoded selectors. When your team redesigns the settings page, the test finds the new path to the same outcome. Some tools call this agentic testing. Others call it self-healing. The labels vary. The capability is real, when it works.\n\nThe problem: most tools still don't work reliably in production CI/CD. They demo well on a clean todo app. They break on your actual product with auth flows, modals, and third-party iframes.\n\nThis ranking focuses on what holds up in real pipelines, not what looks good in a 3-minute walkthrough.\n\n**Scope note:** This list is weighted toward browser-based E2E and visual regression, but includes mobile-native (#9 Maestro) and LLM evaluation (#11 Promptfoo) because no honest 2026 testing list can ignore them. Accessibility-specific tooling and synthetic data generation are addressed in \"What's not on this list\" below.\n\nTool\n\nBest for\n\nCore tech\n\nPricing model\n\n**Applitools**\n\nVisual regression\n\nVisual AI\n\n~$10K-50K/yr\n\n**Bug0 Studio**\n\nAgentic E2E and video-to-code\n\nPlaywright + vision models\n\n~$250/mo (usage)\n\n**QA Wolf**\n\nDone-for-you service\n\nHuman + AI hybrid\n\n~$5K+/mo\n\n**Testim / Tricentis**\n\nEnterprise legacy\n\nSmart locators\n\n~$30K-100K/yr\n\n**Qodo** (formerly CodiumAI)\n\nUnit test generation\n\nCode analysis\n\nFree / $30/user/mo\n\n**Mabl**\n\nLow-code teams\n\nSaaS cloud\n\n~$499/mo\n\n**Functionize**\n\nData-heavy apps\n\nML engine\n\n~$20K-60K/yr\n\n**Diffblue**\n\nJava unit testing\n\nAI code gen\n\n~$500/seat/yr\n\n**Maestro**\n\nMobile-native testing\n\nAccessibility tree + YAML DSL\n\nOpen source / ~$250/mo per device\n\n**Percy**\n\nVisual snapshots\n\nPixel comparison\n\n~$399/mo\n\n**Promptfoo**\n\nLLM output evaluation\n\nAssertion framework\n\nOpen source / enterprise custom\n\n**Checkie.AI** (now Testers.AI)\n\nAutonomous testing agent\n\nVision AI\n\n~$1,777/yr\n\n* * *\n\n## **How we ranked these tools**\n\nThree criteria matter when evaluating generative AI testing tools. Everything else is noise.\n\n### **Agentic capabilities**\n\nCan the tool explore your UI without hardcoded steps? Agentic testing means the AI navigates your application like a real user. It reads the screen, decides where to click, and adapts when the layout changes. Most tools still require you to define every step. A few actually think for themselves.\n\nThe difference matters in practice. A traditional test says \"click the button with id `submit-btn`.\" An agentic test says \"submit the form.\" When your designer renames that button or moves it to a different section, the agentic test still works. The traditional test breaks.\n\n![Diagram showing two flows side by side: a linear scripted test that breaks when a button selector changes versus an agentic test that re-navigates to the same goal through a different path after a UI redesign](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/d77d50cd-0e79-4f3e-9011-e375173eed46.png)\n\n### **Self-healing tests**\n\nEvery tool claims self-healing. Few deliver it. Real self-healing means when your `#add-to-cart` button becomes `.btn-cart`, the test updates its own selectors and passes on the next run. No alerts. No manual fixes. 90% of tools claim this capability. Maybe 20% handle it reliably in production CI/CD runs.\n\nWe evaluated each tool by running identical UI changes against their test suites and measuring how many tests survived without human intervention.\n\n### **Tech stack and lock-in**\n\nDoes the tool generate standard [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) code, or does it lock you into a proprietary format you can never leave? This matters more than most teams realize. If you build 500 tests on a platform that uses a custom DSL, you're stuck. If it generates Playwright under the hood, your tests have value beyond the vendor.\n\nWe also factored in pricing model. The industry is moving from flat SaaS subscriptions to usage-based billing (per test minute, per agent hour, per inference call). When comparing tools, we normalized to cost-per-test-run rather than sticker price. A tool at $250/month that runs 200 tests and a tool at $2,000/month that runs 5,000 tests have very different unit economics.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#1: Applitools (best for visual AI)**\n\nApplitools built visual AI testing before the rest of the industry cared about it. Their \"Eyes\" technology compares screenshots across builds, browsers, and viewports using AI that understands layout rather than pixel-matching. It catches the visual regressions that functional tests miss entirely.\n\n![Screenshot of Applitools in action.](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/73a47db8-a783-4223-997a-03813c3d47f8.png)\n\n**Starting price:** Custom enterprise (typically $10K-50K/year depending on test volume and browser matrix)\n\n**Best for:** Teams with existing test suites who need visual regression coverage across browsers and devices.\n\nApplitools earns the #1 spot because of maturity and reliability. They've been solving visual testing for years, and their AI has been trained on millions of screenshots. The Ultrafast Grid runs your visual checks across dozens of browser/viewport combinations in seconds, not minutes.\n\nTheir root cause analysis feature (shipped originally in 2018, refined since) surfaces the DOM and CSS differences behind visual failures. When a test fails, the platform shows which specific CSS property or DOM change caused the layout shift. That saves your team 15-20 minutes per failure investigation.\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Visual AI that distinguishes meaningful layout changes from harmless rendering differences\n- Ultrafast Grid renders across dozens of browser/viewport/device combinations in parallel\n- Integrates with Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, and most existing frameworks\n- Root cause analysis that surfaces the specific CSS or DOM change behind visual regressions\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- You still need to write the test scripts yourself. Applitools validates what you see, not what you do\n- Enterprise pricing puts it out of reach for startups and small teams\n- Setup requires SDK integration into your existing test framework\n- No test generation. It's a validation layer, not a creation tool\n\n**The verdict:** If your users see it, Applitools catches it. But you still need another tool to generate the tests in the first place.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#2: Bug0 Studio (best for agentic E2E and video-to-code)**\n\nBug0 Studio takes three types of input (plain English, video uploads, browser screen recordings) and converts them into Playwright-based test steps. The platform runs tests on its own infrastructure and auto-heals selectors when UI changes break locators.\n\n**Starting price:** ~$250/month (pay-as-you-go for test minutes, scales with usage)\n\n**Best for:** Engineering teams that want to generate E2E tests from recordings or natural language without writing Playwright code themselves.\n\nThe video-to-code feature is the main differentiator. You record yourself walking through a user flow. The AI produces a Playwright test from the recording. Other tools attempt this, but most generate outputs that need significant manual cleanup before they pass in CI. Bug0's output tends to be closer to runnable on the first attempt, though complex flows with auth tokens or multi-step modals still need editing.\n\n![Bug0 Studio interface converting a screen recording into Playwright test steps with editable step list and run controls](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/cc6fa320-947c-4121-bad7-b0e7b03ec82c.png)\n\nThe agentic testing angle is real but worth qualifying. When you write a step like \"complete the checkout flow,\" the AI agent navigates your app dynamically rather than replaying exact coordinates. If the checkout page gets redesigned, the agent looks for the new path. It works well for standard flows (forms, navigation, CRUD operations). It struggles with highly custom UI patterns and edge cases the way any AI agent does.\n\nSelf-healing runs during scheduled and manual test runs. When a selector breaks, the AI updates the locator. When it can't fix it, you get an alert. The failure mode is explicit, which matters more than the success rate.\n\nIt's a younger platform than most on this list, which cuts both ways. Fast iteration on features, but less battle-testing in large-scale production environments.\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Video-to-code produces Playwright tests that are close to runnable from screen recordings\n- Natural language test creation lowers the barrier for non-Playwright teams\n- Failed test reports include video, AI analysis, network logs, and console traces\n- GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- Newer platform with a smaller community. Less Stack Overflow coverage when you hit edge cases\n- Tests run on Bug0's infrastructure only. You can't export standalone Playwright scripts and can't debug tests locally in VS Code the way you would with standard Playwright\n- No self-serve signup yet. Requires a demo call to get started\n- Complex auth flows and custom UI components still need manual step editing\n\n**The verdict:** The strongest option for generating E2E tests from video or natural language. The trade-off is platform maturity and vendor lock-in on test execution. Worth a trial if your team doesn't have Playwright expertise in-house.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#3: QA Wolf (best for service-based hybrid)**\n\nQA Wolf isn't a tool. It's a service. You don't write tests. They do.\n\n**Starting price:** Custom pricing (typically $5K+/month)\n\n**Best for:** Teams that want test coverage without any involvement in test creation or maintenance.\n\nQA Wolf pairs human QA engineers with AI automation to deliver end-to-end test suites. You get coverage. They handle everything: planning, writing, maintaining, and verifying test results. Their pitch is simple. You build features. They make sure nothing breaks.\n\nThe model works well for teams that don't have QA headcount and don't want to hire. You get a dedicated team that writes Playwright tests, maintains them when UI changes, and reviews every failure before it reaches your engineers.\n\n![Screenshot of QA Wolf dashboard that displays the list of tests.](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/511d38d8-c14c-4ecd-b08c-373be774412e.png)\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Zero maintenance burden on your team. They own the test suite end-to-end\n- Human verification of every failure. No false positives reaching your developers\n- Strong Playwright expertise. Tests are well-structured and reliable\n- Guaranteed coverage timelines\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- Expensive for smaller teams. The service model has higher minimums than self-serve tools\n- Less control over test creation. You're trusting their judgment on what to test\n- Slower iteration. Requesting new tests means going through their team, not clicking a button\n- Dependency on their capacity. Scaling up means waiting for their availability\n\n**The verdict:** If you'd rather buy results than operate tools, QA Wolf delivers. The trade-off is cost and control. Compare this to Bug0 Studio if you want the same AI-powered testing but with self-serve control at a lower price point.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#4: Testim by Tricentis (best for enterprise stability)**\n\n![Testim tool screenshot.](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/84290ef0-fe76-461c-8c97-35f1ca08acb3.png)\n\nTestim is the tool your procurement team already approved.\n\n**Starting price:** Custom enterprise (typically $30K-100K+/year depending on seat count and modules licensed)\n\n**Best for:** Large organizations (500+ employees) with existing Tricentis contracts or compliance-driven QA processes.\n\nTricentis acquired Testim in early 2022 for $200M and integrated it into their enterprise suite alongside Tosca and qTest. (Testim remains a separately branded, actively maintained product.) The specific feature that matters: Smart Locators. These use a weighted algorithm across multiple element attributes (text content, CSS class, XPath, surrounding DOM structure, visual position) to identify elements. When one attribute changes, the locator falls back to the others. The practical result: fewer false failures from routine UI changes compared to single-attribute selectors.\n\nIn practice, Smart Locators handle straightforward UI changes well (button text changes, class renames, minor layout shifts). They struggle when multiple attributes change simultaneously, like during a major redesign. That's the gap between \"adaptive locators\" and actual agentic testing.\n\nThe platform also includes Testim's root cause analysis feature, which groups related test failures and identifies the likely source commit. This works through Git integration, not AI inference. It's useful when 15 tests break from one deploy and you need to know which PR caused it.\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Smart Locators using weighted multi-attribute element identification reduce false failures\n- Root cause analysis links test failures to specific commits via Git integration\n- SOC2, SAML SSO, RBAC, audit logs. The full enterprise compliance checklist\n- Embedded in the Tricentis ecosystem (Tosca, qTest, NeoLoad) if you already use their stack\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- Tricentis ships major feature updates quarterly. Smaller competitors iterate weekly\n- Pricing is five or six figures annually. You're paying for the enterprise wrapper\n- Initial setup involves professional services. Expect 4-8 weeks to full deployment\n- The AI features (test generation from NLP) were added post-acquisition and feel bolted on compared to the core locator tech\n\n**The verdict:** If you already use Tricentis products or your security team requires vendor questionnaires with SOC2 Type II attestation, Testim is the path of least resistance. The AI capabilities are real but conservative. You're buying reliability, not innovation.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#5: Qodo (formerly CodiumAI) (best for unit testing and developer workflows)**\n\nQodo (rebranded from CodiumAI in September 2024) solves a different problem than the other tools on this list. It generates unit and integration tests, not browser-based E2E tests.\n\n![Qodo homepage screenshot.](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/c4b05825-172e-4ed3-8678-ed7f68c7bf66.png)\n\n**Starting price:** Free tier (75 credits/month). Teams at $30/user/month.\n\n**Best for:** Individual developers who want AI-generated unit tests inside their IDE.\n\nQodo Gen (formerly Codiumate) analyzes your code and generates test cases that cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and error paths. It works inside VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, generating tests as you write code. The AI understands your function signatures, dependencies, and logic flow to produce meaningful tests.\n\nThis is valuable for improving code-level coverage. But it doesn't replace E2E testing. Qodo won't tell you if your checkout flow breaks after a deploy. It tells you if your `calculateTotal()` function handles null inputs correctly.\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Fast, contextual unit test generation inside the IDE\n- Good at finding edge cases developers miss\n- Free tier (75 credits/month) is generous enough for individual use\n- Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and more\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- Not an E2E testing tool. No browser automation. No visual testing\n- Generated tests sometimes need manual adjustment for complex business logic\n- Doesn't integrate with CI/CD as a standalone QA solution\n- Limited value for QA teams. This is a developer tool\n\n**The verdict:** Great for developers who want better unit test coverage. Wrong tool for QA engineers evaluating E2E solutions. Include it in your developer toolkit, but don't count on it as your testing strategy.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#6: Mabl (best for low-code testing)**\n\nMabl makes test automation accessible to people who don't write code. That's its strength and its ceiling.\n\n![Mabl tool screenshot](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/530389ee-2d9b-43b3-9cbf-d75d7b7ea97f.png)\n\n**Starting price:** Around $499/month for small teams\n\n**Best for:** Teams transitioning from manual testing to automation, with non-technical QA members.\n\nMabl's visual test builder lets you create tests by clicking through your application. The platform records your actions and generates tests with built-in assertions. AI-powered auto-healing updates selectors when elements change. It runs tests in Mabl's cloud, so there's no infrastructure to manage.\n\nThe onboarding experience is genuinely good. Non-technical QA team members can create meaningful tests within hours. The learning curve is shallow by design.\n\n**What works:**\n\n- Visual test builder requires zero coding\n- Auto-healing keeps tests running after UI changes\n- Cloud execution with no infrastructure management\n- Good onboarding for non-technical team members\n\n**What doesn't:**\n\n- Pricing scales up quickly as test volume grows\n- Limited flexibility for complex testing scenarios\n- You'll hit the ceiling fast if your application has intricate workflows\n- Proprietary format. Your tests live in Mabl. No easy migration path\n\n**The verdict:** Solid training wheels for test automation. If your team is new to automated testing, Mabl gets you started quickly. But expect to outgrow it within 12-18 months as your testing needs mature.\n\n* * *\n\n## **#7-#12: Six more tools worth knowing**\n\n### **#7: Functionize (best for data-heavy applications)**\n\nFunctionize runs ML models against your historical test execution data to predict which tests are likely to fail after a given code change. The platform prioritizes test runs based on risk scoring, so your CI pipeline runs the most relevant tests first.\n\n**Starting price:** Custom enterprise (typically $20K-60K/year based on test volume).\n\nThe core feature is adaptive test maintenance. Functionize tracks how your application's DOM structure changes over time and uses that history to update selectors before they break, not after. This works better than reactive self-healing for applications with predictable change patterns (e.g., a dashboard that adds new widgets regularly). NLP-based test creation is available but inconsistent. The plain-English-to-test conversion works for simple flows. Multi-step workflows with conditional logic need manual scripting.\n\n**The verdict:** Useful if your bottleneck is test prioritization across a large suite (500+ tests). The ML-based risk scoring saves CI minutes. But the enterprise-only pricing and 6-8 week onboarding make it hard to justify unless your test suite is already large enough to benefit from intelligent prioritization.\n\n### **#8: Diffblue (best for Java unit testing)**\n\nDiffblue Cover automatically writes unit tests for Java code. It analyzes your codebase and generates JUnit tests that achieve high code coverage. The company raised $6.3M in late 2024 from existing investors and remains independently operated, focused exclusively on Java.\n\n**Starting price:** Per-seat licensing (typically $500+/seat/year).\n\n**The verdict:** If your stack is Java and you need unit test coverage fast, Diffblue does it better than any general-purpose AI. Useless for anything else.\n\n### **#9: Maestro (best for mobile-native agentic testing)**\n\nMaestro is the closest thing to Playwright-style agentic testing for iOS and Android. You write flows in a YAML-based DSL, and the framework navigates native UI elements without relying on brittle XPath selectors. It reads the screen's accessibility tree and matches elements by label, type, and hierarchy.\n\n**Starting price:** Open source (free). Maestro Cloud starts at ~$250/month per device for CI execution.\n\nThe framework includes auto-wait logic that adapts to animation timing and network latency. MaestroGPT can help generate YAML flows, but the primary authoring experience is YAML, not natural language. (The team actually built and shut down a pure NL testing product, concluding that declarative YAML was more reliable.) It handles the problem that kills most Appium tests: timing flakiness on real devices. The limitation is ecosystem. Maestro's community is smaller than Playwright's, and complex gestures (multi-finger swipe, drag-and-drop) still need manual scripting.\n\n**The verdict:** If you ship mobile apps alongside your web product, Maestro is the only tool on this list that covers native iOS/Android. Open source core keeps costs low. But expect to invest in writing flows manually. The AI generation layer isn't as mature as web-side tools.\n\n### **#10: Percy by BrowserStack (best for visual snapshot testing)**\n\nPercy captures screenshots of your application during test runs and flags visual differences between builds. BrowserStack acquired Percy to complement their browser testing infrastructure.\n\n**Starting price:** Starts at ~$399/month for the Team plan. Free tier includes 5,000 monthly screenshots.\n\nPercy integrates with your existing test framework (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium) and adds a visual review layer. The review UI lets your team approve or reject visual changes per build.\n\n**The verdict:** A lighter, cheaper alternative to Applitools for teams that need visual regression coverage without the enterprise pricing. Less sophisticated AI, but covers the basics.\n\n### **#11: Promptfoo (best for LLM output evaluation)**\n\nPromptfoo is an open-source framework for testing LLM outputs. If your product includes AI features (chatbots, summarization, search), you need to verify that model responses are accurate, safe, and consistent. Promptfoo runs test suites against your prompts and scores responses on criteria like factual accuracy, toxicity, and format compliance.\n\n**Starting price:** Open source (free). Promptfoo Enterprise for team collaboration uses custom pricing.\n\nThis isn't browser testing. It's a different category entirely. But including it matters because the biggest QA challenge for many teams isn't \"does the button work\" but \"does the AI hallucinate.\" Promptfoo lets you define assertions like \"response must not contain PII\" or \"answer must reference only provided context documents\" and runs them against hundreds of prompt variations. Red teaming presets test for jailbreaks and safety violations out of the box.\n\n**The verdict:** If you ship LLM-powered features, you need an evaluation framework alongside your browser E2E suite. Promptfoo is the most accessible option: open source, CLI-first, and integrates with CI/CD via an official GitHub Action. Different category than the other tools here, but arguably more critical for teams building AI products.\n\n### **#12: Checkie.AI / Testers.AI (best for autonomous AI agent testing)**\n\nCheckie.AI rebranded to Testers.AI and now positions itself as a \"virtual test team.\" It uses vision AI agents to test web applications by looking at the screen rather than parsing the DOM.\n\n**Starting price:** Core Coverage at $1,777/year. Pro at $4,777/year.\n\nThe vision-first approach means it can test applications that resist traditional automation (heavy canvas rendering, complex SVGs, WebGL). The rebrand reflects a shift from pure vision testing to a broader autonomous testing agent that covers functionality, performance, and security.\n\n**The verdict:** No longer early access but still a small player. Worth evaluating if your application has unusual rendering that breaks traditional DOM-based automation.\n\n* * *\n\n## **What's not on this list (but should be on your radar)**\n\nThis ranking includes mobile (#9 Maestro) and LLM evaluation (#11 Promptfoo) alongside the browser-focused tools. Three categories still didn't make the cut but affect most teams.\n\n### **Accessibility testing under the European Accessibility Act**\n\nThe European Accessibility Act (EAA) enforcement started in mid-2025. If you serve EU customers, automated accessibility testing is a compliance requirement, not a nice-to-have. axe-core handles rule-based a11y checks. The newer tools (Evinced, accessiBe's CI scanner, and Arc Toolkit) use AI to detect issues that rule-based systems miss: poor color contrast in dynamic themes, keyboard navigation dead ends, screen reader incompatibility in SPAs. None of the 12 tools above handle this well. You need a dedicated a11y layer in your pipeline. Budget for it separately.\n\n### **Synthetic test data generation**\n\nMost AI testing tools focus on scripts and ignore the data problem. Your E2E tests need realistic user data: names, emails, addresses, payment details. Using production data in staging is a PII risk. Hardcoding test data makes tests brittle and tightly coupled to specific database states. Tools like Tonic.ai, Gretel, and Snaplet generate synthetic datasets that match your production schema without exposing real user data. If your test failures are caused by bad test data more often than bad scripts, this is where to invest first.\n\n### **Pricing models are shifting under you**\n\nThe pricing models on this list still mostly reflect the SaaS subscription era. The industry is moving toward usage-based billing: cost per test minute, per agent hour, or per inference call. When comparing tools, normalize costs to \"price per test run on my actual app\" rather than comparing monthly stickers. A tool at $200/month that runs 100 tests and a tool at $2,000/month that runs 10,000 tests have very different unit economics. Ask vendors for their cost-per-test-run on your specific application before signing anything.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Glossary: What the marketing terms actually mean**\n\nEvery vendor uses these terms. Most define them loosely. Here's what to look for when a tool claims each capability.\n\n### **Agentic testing**\n\nA test system that receives a goal and decides the navigation steps at runtime. Concrete example: you write \"add an item to the cart and check out.\" The agent opens your app, finds a product (even if the product grid layout changed since last run), clicks \"Add to cart,\" navigates to checkout, and fills the form. If your team moves the cart icon from the header to a sidebar, the agent locates it in the new position. The key distinction from record-and-replay: agentic tests don't store a fixed sequence of DOM interactions. They re-plan each run.\n\n### **Self-healing**\n\nThe test runner detects that a selector (`#submit-btn`) no longer matches any element, searches for the most likely replacement (maybe `button.primary-action` or the button with text \"Submit\"), updates the locator, and passes. This happens during the CI run, not after a human intervenes. When evaluating vendors, ask: \"What's your self-heal success rate on production UI changes, not demo apps?\" Most won't give you a number. The ones that do are worth talking to.\n\n![Process diagram of self-healing test mechanics: selector fails, AI searches for replacement by text content and DOM position and visual location, updates locator, re-runs assertion, passes or alerts human](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/046d056a-df2c-4143-a3d3-66b1f0b1bd08.png)\n\n### **Video-to-code**\n\nYou record a Loom (or any screen recording) of yourself completing a user flow. The tool's vision model watches the recording frame-by-frame, identifies each interaction (clicks, typing, scrolling, waiting for elements to load), and outputs a Playwright test script. The practical test: upload a 60-second recording of your actual app's login-to-dashboard flow. If the output passes without edits, the tool works. If you spend 20 minutes fixing selectors and adding waits, it doesn't.\n\n### **Generative AI in software testing**\n\nAI that creates complete, new test cases rather than assisting with ones you've already written. The distinction matters: Copilot autocompleting your `expect()` statement is AI-assisted testing. A tool that analyzes your app's routes and produces 50 test cases covering happy paths, error states, and edge cases is generative AI in software testing. The output is a full test suite, not a code suggestion.\n\n### **Intent-based testing**\n\nWriting test assertions as outcomes (\"user sees confirmation page with order number\") rather than implementation steps (`await page.waitForSelector('.order-confirmation'); expect(page.locator('.order-id')).toBeVisible()`). The testing system translates the intent into specific DOM interactions based on the current state of the page. When the confirmation page gets redesigned, the intent stays the same. The implementation steps update automatically.\n\n![Diagram comparing traditional selector-based testing flow versus intent-based agentic testing flow, showing how each handles a UI redesign](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/dd4c7e1e-a8c7-4e17-8f21-58058744e6b3.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## **Stop writing scripts, start auditing results**\n\nThe generative AI testing tools market has real options now, not just demos. The right choice depends on your constraint.\n\n**If pixel-perfect UI matters most,** Applitools remains the gold standard for visual regression. Pair it with any test generation tool.\n\n**If you want to describe tests in English or record a video and get working Playwright suites,** [Bug0 Studio](https://bug0.com/) is the strongest option for agentic testing and video-to-code.\n\n**If you want zero involvement in testing,** QA Wolf and similar managed services handle everything. You pay more, but you do less.\n\n**If enterprise procurement drives your decisions,** Testim by Tricentis checks every compliance box.\n\nThe common thread across the best tools: they test intent, not implementation. They heal when UI changes. They generate [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) code, not proprietary scripts. Your job isn't to write tests anymore. It's to define what \"working\" means and let the tools prove it.\n\n* * *\n\n## **FAQs**\n\n### **What is generative AI testing?**\n\nAI that produces complete test cases from inputs like natural language, video recordings, or application analysis. The \"generative\" part distinguishes it from AI-assisted testing (like Copilot autocompleting your test code). A generative tool takes \"test the login flow with invalid credentials\" and outputs a full Playwright script with navigation, input, submission, and error assertion. You run it. It either passes or it doesn't.\n\n### **How is agentic testing different from traditional test automation?**\n\nTraditional automation stores a fixed sequence: click `#login-btn`, type into `#email-field`, assert `.dashboard` is visible. If any selector changes, the test fails. Agentic testing stores the goal: \"log in and verify the dashboard loads.\" At runtime, the agent inspects the current page, identifies the login form regardless of its selectors, fills it, and checks the result. The practical difference shows up after a UI redesign. Traditional tests need manual updates. Agentic tests re-plan the steps automatically. The limitation: agents still fail on ambiguous UIs where multiple valid paths exist, or when your app requires non-obvious interaction patterns.\n\n### **Do video-to-code tools actually work in production?**\n\nRun this test yourself: record a 90-second flow through your actual app (not a demo). Include a login, at least one form interaction, and a page navigation. Upload it to the tool. If the generated test passes in CI without edits, the tool works for your use case. In our evaluation, most tools required 15-40 minutes of manual cleanup per recording on real applications. A few produced near-runnable output. The variable is your app's complexity, specifically dynamic content, custom components, and third-party embeds are where video-to-code breaks down.\n\n### **Can AI testing replace QA engineers?**\n\nIt replaces the tasks nobody wants to do: maintaining 300 selectors, re-running regression suites manually, writing boilerplate test setup. It doesn't replace the judgment calls. Deciding which flows are critical, interpreting whether a visual change is intentional or a bug, understanding that \"the button works but the UX is confusing\"â¦ those need a human. The teams getting the most value use AI for coverage and repetition while their QA engineers focus on test strategy, exploratory testing, and release decisions.\n\n### **Which tool should I choose for my team?**\n\nStart with your biggest problem, not the most impressive demo. If your tests break every sprint from UI changes, you need self-healing (Applitools, Bug0 Studio, Testim). If you have no tests at all, you need generation (Bug0 Studio, Qodo, Mabl). If you don't have anyone to own the test suite, you need a service (QA Wolf). If your procurement process takes 6 months and you need to start now, pick a tool with a free tier (Qodo, Maestro) and evaluate enterprise options in parallel.\n\n### **How much does Bug0 Studio cost?**\n\nStarts at ~$250/month pay-as-you-go for test minutes. Scales with usage. Unlimited tests, test suites, and AI credits included. Bug0 Managed (done-for-you QA with dedicated engineers) starts at ~$2,500/month flat. For comparison, Applitools runs $10K-50K/year, Testim/Tricentis runs $30K-100K/year, and QA Wolf starts around $5K/month.\n\n### **What should I test during a vendor evaluation?**\n\nDon't use the vendor's demo app. Record your actual application's most complex user flow, the one that breaks the most. Upload it or describe it in natural language. Run the generated test in your staging environment. Then change something in the UI (rename a button, move a section) and run the test again without updating it. That second run tells you whether the self-healing actually works. Most vendors will happily demo on their own app. The ones that let you test on yours during the evaluation are the ones worth shortlisting.\n\n- [#ai](/blog/tag/ai)\n- [#ai-qa](/blog/tag/ai-qa)\n- [#ai-testing-tools](/blog/tag/ai-testing-tools)\n\n## Recent posts\n\n- [![Cover Image for The AI-native stack (2026): From text-to-app to agentic QA](https://cloudmate-test.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/covers/54b81b237393d8e81463c55c/8fc09910-f2d1-4a6d-8582-44db2bdc5f15.jpg)](/blog/the-ai-native-stack-2026-from-text-to-app-to-agentic-qa)\n  \n  ### [The AI-native stack (2026): From text-to-app to agentic QA](/blog/the-ai-native-stack-2026-from-text-to-app-to-agentic-qa)\n  \n  [ai](/blog/tag/ai)[ai-tools](/blog/tag/ai-tools)[vibe-coding](/blog/tag/vibe-coding)\n  \n  [The AI-native SDLC in 2026: v0, Cursor, Bug0, Vercel, and Sentry.

Many organizations are running GenAI pilots that never translate into real, repeatable delivery improvementsâoften because they donât integrate GenAI into workflows, metrics, and governance.\n\nIn 2026, [Generative AI in software testing](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/generative-ai-software-testing-trends-predictions-2026-guide/) shifts from experimentation to operationalization. Winning QA teams will define test intent (not just test cases), add evaluation gates (âevalsâ) in CI, and require self-explaining automation with evidence. The goal isnât faster outputâitâs measurable confidence with governance and ROI.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Define test intent + oracles** so AI-generated tests prove the right outcomes.\n- **Add eval gates in CI** (golden sets + scoring) before AI artifacts ship.\n- **Make automation self-explaining** with failure narratives + evidence links.\n\nSo instead of another âAI will change testingâ article, letâs talk about what will *actually* change in 2026âand what high-performing QA teams will do differently.\n\n## **Why 2026 feels different from 2024â2025**\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[Toggle](#)\n\n- [Why 2026 feels different from 2024â2025](#Why_2026_feels_different_from_2024%E2%80%932025)\n- [10 trends that will define GenAI in software testing in 2026](#10_trends_that_will_define_GenAI_in_software_testing_in_2026)\n- [What QA teams will stop doing in 2026](#What_QA_teams_will_stop_doing_in_2026)\n- [What QA teams will start doing in 2026](#What_QA_teams_will_start_doing_in_2026)\n- [The Testleaf perspective: the âConfidence Stackâ for GenAI-era testing](#The_Testleaf_perspective_the_%E2%80%9CConfidence_Stack%E2%80%9D_for_GenAI-era_testing)\n- [A practical 90-day roadmap for QA leaders (2026-ready)](#A_practical_90-day_roadmap_for_QA_leaders_2026-ready)\n- [The biggest prediction for 2026](#The_biggest_prediction_for_2026)\n- [1.

Whatâs the biggest mistake teams make with GenAI in QA?](#7_Whats_the_biggest_mistake_teams_make_with_GenAI_in_QA)\n\n2024â2025 was experimentation: prompts, copilots, test generation demos, âAI in QAâ talks.\n\n2026 is operationalization. The questions shift from:\n\n- âCan GenAI help?â to **âWhere exactly does it sit in our SDLC?â**\n- âCan it write tests?â to **âCan it increase confidence without increasing risk?â**\n- âIs it cool?â to **âCan we measure ROI and control failure modes?â**\n\nThis is where thought leadership matters: the teams that win wonât be the ones with the most tools. Theyâll be the ones with the best **quality operating model**.\n\nCI runners in different regions, geo-specific cookie banners, A/B experiments, and first-time user flows can change what the UI shows. If your product serves India + global traffic, treat these as âstate contractsâ and test them explicitlyânot as flaky surprises.\n\n## **[10 trends](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/top-10-software-testing-trends-in-2025/) that will define GenAI in software testing in 2026**\n\n### **1) Test design moves from âtest casesâ to âtest intentâ**\n\n**What changes:** We stop counting test cases and start defining **intent, constraints, and oracles**.  \n**Why it matters:** GenAI can generate *quantity*. The bottleneck becomes correctness.  \n**Example:** âCheckout must never charge twiceâ becomes an invariant tested across flows.\n\n### **2) âSelf-healingâ becomes âself-explainingâ**\n\n**What changes:** Instead of silently fixing locators, systems will produce **failure narratives**:\n\n- what changed,\n- what signal supports it (network/console/DOM),\n- what fix is most likely.  \n  **Why it matters:** AI that âhealsâ without explaining creates hidden risk.\n\n### **3) AI-driven [flaky test](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/is-playwright-automation-the-end-of-flaky-tests-heres-the-truth/) triage becomes standard**\n\n**What changes:** AI will classify failures into buckets (app bug vs environment vs test debt) and propose next actions.  \n**Failure mode:** Teams accept AI classifications without evidence.  \n**What to do:** Require âevidence linksâ (logs, traces, diffs) in the triage output.\n\n### **4) Evaluation pipelines (âevalsâ) become the new unit tests**\n\n**What changes:** GenAI outputs (tests, data, summaries, defect reports) get scored before they merge.  \n**Why it matters:** Without evaluation, GenAI becomes a productivity *illusion*.  \n**What to do:** Create âgolden setsâ of expected outcomes and regression them in CI.\n\n### **5) Change-impact testing becomes more important than full regression**\n\n**What changes:** Teams prioritize *what changed â what might break*.  \n**Why it matters:** Release velocity wonât slow down. Confidence must become smarter, not bigger.\n\n[![Gen AI Masterclass](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gen-AI-Masterclass.png)](https://ai-master-class.testleaf.com/?utm_source=GenAI_Webinar\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=GenAI_Webinar_Blog)\n\n### **6) Synthetic test data becomes a first-class artifact (with governance)**\n\n**What changes:** GenAI-generated data sets become reusable assets.  \n**Failure mode:** Privacy leaks or unrealistic distributions.  \n**What to do:** Treat synthetic data like code: review, version, validate.\n\n### **7) QA expands into prompt-risk and output-risk testing**\n\nIf your product uses [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), testing now includes adversarial scenarios:\n\n- prompt injection,\n- insecure output handling,\n- data leakage behaviors.\n\nOWASP explicitly calls out **Prompt Injection** and **Insecure Output Handling** as top risks for LLM applications.  \n**2026 prediction:** QA and security test plans merge hereâwhether org charts catch up or not.\n\n### **8) Agentic testing growsâbut many projects get scrapped**\n\nAgentic testing (AI agents that plan, execute, and decide) will growâbut also face reality checks: cost, unclear outcomes, and âagent washing.â Reuters reported Gartnerâs view that **over 40% of agentic AI projects may be scrapped by 2027**.  \n**What to do:** Keep agency limited. Let agents *suggest*, not *ship*, unless the risk is low.\n\n### **9) Observability becomes part of âtestingâ**\n\n**What changes:** Quality isnât only pre-prod. Teams use production signals (SLIs/SLOs, tracing, error budgets) as test oracles.  \n**Why it matters:** Modern systems fail in integration edges, not unit-level logic.\n\n### **10) ROI + governance becomes the real differentiator**\n\nMany GenAI initiatives fail not because models are weak, but because integration and measurement are weak.  \n**2026 prediction:** Leadership will fund QA teams that can say:\n\n- âWe reduced triage time by X%â\n- âWe lowered defect escape rate by Yâ\n- âWe increased release confidence with measurable signalsâ\n\n![10 genai testing trends that will define 2026](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/10-genai-testing-trends-that-will-define-2026.webp)\n\n## **What [QA teams](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/12-best-ai-tools-for-automation-testing-in-2025-ultimate-guide-for-qa-teams/) will stop doing in 2026**\n\n- Writing repetitive test cases from scratch\n- Treating automation output as the only âquality signalâ\n- Running massive regressions without change-impact prioritization\n- Accepting AI outputs without evaluation, evidence, or review\n- Leaving GenAI risk testing entirely to âsecurity laterâ\n\n## **What QA teams will start doing in 2026**\n\n- Maintaining **eval suites** alongside test suites\n- Using **quality prompts** (intent + constraints + oracle definition) as reusable assets\n- Building **failure narratives** as a standard artifact of every run\n- Validating AI features with adversarial prompt libraries (red-team sets)\n- Tracking confidence with a **Quality Metrics Dashboard**, not a âpass rateâ screenshot\n\n![QA in 2026](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/QA-in-2026.webp)\n\n## **The [Testleaf](https://www.testleaf.com/?utm_source=blog_post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post) perspective: the âConfidence Stackâ for GenAI-era testing**\n\nHereâs a simple model that scales better than tool-chasing:\n\n1. **Intent** â what are we proving? (risk-based)\n2. **Evidence** â what signals prove it? (logs, traces, checks)\n3. **Evaluation** â how do we score reliability? (golden sets, regressions)\n4. **Governance** â whatâs allowed to be autonomous? (policy + approvals)\n\nIf you implement only the âAI generationâ layer without evaluation and governance, youâll create faster outputâbut not faster trust.\n\n## **A practical [90-day roadmap](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/software-testing-roadmap-2026-manual-to-ai/) for QA leaders (2026-ready)**\n\n##### **Weeks 1â2: Choose use cases + draw risk boundaries**\n\n- Pick 2â3 measurable use cases (triage summaries, test intent generation, data generation)\n- Define where AI can act vs where it can only assist\n\n##### **Weeks 3â6: Build your evaluation foundation**\n\n- Create golden sets (expected results)\n- Add scoring gates in CI for AI-created artifacts\n\n##### **Weeks 7â10: Operationalize âself-explainingâ automation**\n\n- Standardize failure narratives\n- Connect test results to evidence (logs/traces/diffs)\n\n##### **Weeks 11â12: Governance + ROI reporting**\n\n- Approval workflows for high-impact changes\n- Dashboard outcomes: time saved, defect containment, release confidence\n\n![QA leader 90 day roadmap](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/QA-leader-90-day-roadmap.webp)\n\n## **The biggest prediction for 2026**\n\nThe most valuable QA professionals wonât be the ones who âuse GenAI.â  \nTheyâll be the ones who can answerâcalmly, consistently, with evidence:\n\n##### **âAre we safe to ship?â**\n\nBecause in an AI-accelerated [SDLC](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle-for-qa-professionals/), **confidence becomes the rarest asset**.\n\nIf youâre building GenAI capability in your QA organization at Testleaf (or anywhere), the goal isnât more automation. The goal is **repeatable confidence**âand the operating model to prove it.\n\nIf you want to stay future-ready, start building practical skills in [***Genai in software testing***](https://www.testleaf.com/course/genai-qa-engineers-training-course.html?utm_source=blog_post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)âfrom intent-first test design to eval gates and evidence-driven QA.  \nJoin our webinar: [***AI Master Class for QA Professionals â Master AI Agents***](https://ai-master-class.testleaf.com/?utm_source=GenAI_Webinar\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=GenAI_Webinar_Blog).  \nReserve your spot and learn how to apply these workflows in real projects.\n\n### **FAQs**\n\n## **1. What is Generative AI in software testing?**\n\nGenAI helps create test ideas, data, summaries, and triage outputsâbut teams must verify results with eval gates and evidence before trusting them.\n\n## **2. What will actually change in software testing in 2026?**\n\nTesting shifts to intent-first design, eval pipelines in CI, and self-explaining automationâso confidence is measurable, not assumed.\n\n## **3. What are âevalsâ in QA and why do they matter?**\n\nEvals are scoring checks for GenAI outputs (tests/data/summaries) using golden sets in CIâwithout them, GenAI becomes a productivity illusion.\n\n## **4. How should QA test LLM features (chatbots, copilots) safely?**\n\nInclude prompt-risk and output-risk testing (e.g., prompt injection, insecure output handling) and treat these as part of the test planânot âlater.â\n\n## **5. Will GenAI replace testers in 2026?**\n\nIt replaces repetitive work, but increases the need for testers who define intent, risks, oracles, and governance for trustworthy releases.\n\n## **6. What should we measure to prove GenAI ROI in testing?**\n\nTrack triage time reduction, defect escape reduction, change-impact coverage, and confidence signals tied to outcomesânot âtests generated.â\n\n## **7. Whatâs the biggest mistake teams make with GenAI in QA?**\n\nShipping without evals and evidence. If you donât score outputs, you canât trust them.\n\n##### **We Also Provide Training In:**\n\n- [**Advanced Selenium Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/selenium-automation-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog_post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**Playwright Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/playwright.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**Gen AI Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/genai-qa-engineers-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**AWS Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/aws-cloud-architect-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**REST API Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/rest-api-testing-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**Full Stack Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/full-stack-developer-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**Appium Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/appium-mobile-automation-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**DevOps Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/dev-ops-master-certification-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n- [**JMeter Performance Training**](https://www.testleaf.com/course/apache-jmeter-testing-training-course.html?utm_source=blog-post\u0026utm_medium=Organic\u0026utm_campaign=Blog_Post)\n\n###### **Authorâs Bio**:\n\n![Kadhir](https://www.testleaf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kadhir.png)\n\nContent Writer at Testleaf, specializing in SEO-driven content for test automation, software development, and cybersecurity.
